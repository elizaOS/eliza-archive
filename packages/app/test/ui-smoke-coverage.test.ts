/**
 * UI-smoke spec-coverage ratchet gate (vitest, boot-free).
 *
 * Sibling to the action-coverage and route-coverage gates. Those gates prove
 * that every action/route is *enumerated* in the smoke matrix — but a spec that
 * is enumerated yet never executed in CI is false confidence. This gate closes
 * that hole on the spec axis: every Playwright spec under test/ui-smoke must be
 * accounted for as exactly one of
 *
 *   1. wired into the keyless CI workflow (scenario-pr.yml) — proven to run on
 *      every PR with no API keys, OR
 *   2. live-only — it genuinely cannot run keyless (needs a live agent runtime,
 *      a cloud sandbox, provider keys, or a running fixture endpoint), with the
 *      hard dependency named, OR
 *   3. tracked keyless debt — fixture-capable and *should* run keyless but is not
 *      yet wired. This bucket is a ratchet: it may only shrink.
 *
 * A new spec that is wired nowhere and classified nowhere fails test #1. Growing
 * the debt bucket past its recorded ceiling fails test #2. Wiring a debt spec
 * into the keyless workflow forces its removal from the debt list (test #2),
 * so coverage can only move forward.
