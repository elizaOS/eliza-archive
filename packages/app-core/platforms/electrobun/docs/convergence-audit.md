# Convergence, Annotation, and Deletion Audit

Generated: 2026-05-17T17:53:44.862Z

Branch: codex/phase-11-event-bridge-wip

Ahead/behind origin/develop: 22	0

Dirty status at generation:

- M packages/app-core/platforms/electrobun/scripts/generate-convergence-audit.ts

## Executive Summary

This audit stops the infrastructure-building spiral. Plugins stay plugins, app plugins stay app/product bundles, connectors stay connector plugins, Electrobun remains the desktop shell, AgentManager remains the runtime owner, and Remotes remain limited to desktop/system capability providers.

The current local branch may still contain multiple phases, but it should not be pushed blindly as a broad mega-PR unless maintainers explicitly want that review shape. The stack recommendation below keeps the work reviewable without changing the architectural boundary decisions.

No Swift host/controller path is part of this architecture. The only retained boundary pattern is typed RPC/local API/SSE between layers.

## Hard No-Migration List

- packages/app
- packages/core
- packages/agent
- packages/app-core
- packages/app-core/platforms/electrobun core shell
- packages/electrobun-remote-plugins
- connector plugins
- provider plugins
- app plugins
- core runtime plugins

## Current Remotes

- eliza.fs
- eliza.git
- eliza.local-model
- eliza.pty
- eliza.runtime
- eliza.surface

eliza.surface remains dev/admin only and is not a production UI replacement.

## Future Remote Candidates

- future.eliza.computer

## Delete/Deprecate Candidates

| Path | Reason | Confidence | Safe Now | Owner Decision | Validation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
packages/app-core/platforms/electrobun/build | Generated local build output. It should not be part of architecture or PR review scope. | medium | no | no | confirm ignored/untracked status, rerun build if removed
dist | Generated local build output. It should not be part of architecture or PR review scope. | medium | no | no | confirm ignored/untracked status, rerun build if removed
plugins/plugin-action-bench | Plugin-shaped directory without package.json. Needs owner review before deletion or restoration. | low | no | yes | search imports, check package registry references
plugins/plugin-google-meet-cute | Plugin-shaped directory without package.json. Needs owner review before deletion or restoration. | low | no | yes | search imports, check package registry references
plugins/plugin-xmtp | Plugin-shaped directory without package.json. Needs owner review before deletion or restoration. | low | no | yes | search imports, check package registry references

## Owner-Decision Items

- future.eliza.computer

## Proposed Annotation Plan

- Add README-level role annotations to trace-first candidates before wiring behavior.
- Use `docs/trace-first-annotations.md` as the first review-boundary map for top trace-first packages.
- Add dynamic-view manifests only for contextual inspection surfaces, not fixed dashboards.
- Keep connector/provider package metadata unchanged unless maintainers already have a metadata convention.
- Keep Remote manifests focused on capability boundaries and trusted/full-permission status.
- Do not add source comments unless a hidden constraint or security boundary would otherwise be unclear.

## PR Stack Recommendation

Do not blindly push every local phase into the platform convergence PR unless maintainers explicitly ask for a mega-PR. Recommended stack:

1. Platform convergence PR
   - first-party Remotes
   - AgentManager-backed eliza.runtime
   - worker invoke/event bridge
   - dynamic view registry/session infrastructure

2. Trace PR
   - TraceStore and TraceService
   - dynamic agent.run.trace view
   - runtime and capability trace hooks

3. Voice instrumentation PR
   - VoiceService
   - mock/text pipeline
   - voice trace integration

4. Live voice adapter PR
   - VoiceRuntimeAdapter
   - live flags
   - ASR/TTS runtime route wiring

5. Voice latency PR
   - latency budgets
   - stream coordinator
   - TTS chunker
   - barge-in semantics

6. Voice validation PR
   - voice:validate scripts
   - structured validation reports

7. Convergence audit PR
   - this matrix and generator
   - no migration or production code changes

| packages/agent | core-runtime | core | leave-alone | no | no | no | low | AgentManager/Electrobun may own lifecycle, but agent runtime code stays in runtime packages. |
| packages/app | production-ui | core | leave-alone | no | no | no | low | Hard no-migration item. Do not replace with eliza.surface or fixed dynamic-view panels. |
| packages/app-core | core-runtime | core | leave-alone | no | no | no | low | Hard no-migration item. Electrobun platform code can add host docs, not absorb app-core ownership. |
| packages/app-core/platforms/electrobun | desktop-shell | core | leave-alone | no | no | no | low | Electrobun is the shell, not the agent runtime. Keep AgentManager as runtime lifecycle owner. |
