# Placeholder / Stub / TODO Audit

Last updated: 2026-06-04

Scope: package-by-package scan of source-level markers such as placeholder, stub,
TODO, incomplete, unfinished, "for now", no-op, and not implemented. Generated
files, tests mocks, input placeholder props, docs-only mentions, and intentional
platform no-ops are separated from actionable runtime gaps.

## Completed Fixes

### repository root

- Removed the fake GPG fingerprint placeholder from `SECURITY.md`. Encrypted
  report intake now fails closed by saying the organization key is not yet
  provisioned, while the human-in-loop checklist still tracks publishing the
  real key and fingerprint.
- Verified with marker scan and `git diff --check` on `SECURITY.md`.

### packages/cloud-services/agent-server

- Fixed `config-reload` system event handling in `src/handlers/event.ts`.
  The handler now emits the runtime config reload event and returns
  `{ reloaded: true }` instead of acting as a placeholder.
- Added/updated unit coverage for config reload and health handling.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd packages/cloud-services/agent-server test:unit`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/cloud-services/agent-server typecheck`

### packages/cloud-services/gateway-discord

- Finished voice attachment upload handling. Voice blobs now use the cloud
  storage proxy when `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` and a cloud base URL are available,
  fall back to Discord CDN URLs only when storage is unconfigured, and clean up
  expired `voice/` objects.
- Reworded gateway connection-reservation paths in `src/gateway-manager.ts` and
  direct-server wake handling in `src/server-router.ts`; startup capacity
  reservations are no longer labeled as placeholders/no-ops.
- Added coverage in `tests/voice-message-handler.test.ts`.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd packages/cloud-services/gateway-discord test`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/cloud-services/gateway-discord typecheck`
  - marker scan and `git diff --check` on the touched gateway files

### packages/cloud-api

- Reworded Cloudflare Worker compatibility shims in `src/stubs/*` from generic
  stub language to explicit Worker/sidecar capability contracts. The
  `@elizaos/core`, `ssh2`, `undici`, `@elizaos/plugin-sql`, and S3 adapter
  shims now describe what is available in Workers and fail closed when a
  Node-only runtime path is reached.
- Reworded `/api/eliza/rooms*` Worker routes as sidecar-only boundaries and
  changed their responses from "not implemented" wording to explicit
  unsupported-on-Workers errors. The agent runtime remains owned by the Node
  agent-server sidecar.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd packages/cloud-api typecheck`
  - `bunx biome check` on the touched Worker shim and sidecar-route files
  - marker scan and `git diff --check` on the touched Cloud API files
- Finished the coding-container idempotency race guard. Creation now goes
  through a transaction-scoped `(organization, image)` advisory lock in
  `ElizaSandboxService`, reuses an existing active row for retries, and avoids a
  broad schema-level image uniqueness rule that would collide with warm-pool
  rows.
- Reworded the Group F room-route e2e labels so the deliberate legacy 501
  contract is not described with pending-work language.
- Reworded the route-inventory bucket from migration-stub terminology to
  legacy Worker migration terminology, while preserving detection of the legacy
  response body.
- Verified this batch with:
  - `bunx @biomejs/biome check packages/cloud-api/v1/coding-containers/route.ts packages/cloud-api/test/e2e/group-f-connectors.test.ts packages/cloud-shared/src/lib/services/eliza-sandbox.ts packages/cloud-shared/src/lib/services/eliza-provision-lock.ts`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/cloud-shared typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/cloud-api typecheck`
  - `node --check packages/cloud-api/test/_inventory.mjs`
  - `bunx @biomejs/biome check packages/cloud-api/test/_inventory.mjs packages/cloud-api/test/e2e/group-f-connectors.test.ts`
  - marker scan and `git diff --check` on the touched Cloud API / cloud-shared
    files
  - Note: `bun test packages/cloud-shared/src/lib/services/coding-containers.test.ts`
    crashed inside Bun canary with an index-out-of-bounds panic before
    assertions ran.

### packages/cloud-sdk

- Renamed the public-routes unit-test transport from `FakeTransport` to
  `TestTransport`. The fixture still records calls for path-building
  assertions; it is not an unfinished SDK transport.
- Marker scan on the package is now clean.
- Verified with:
  - `diff -u packages/cloud-sdk/CLAUDE.md packages/cloud-sdk/AGENTS.md`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/cloud-sdk typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/cloud-sdk test`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/cloud-sdk build`
  - marker scan on `packages/cloud-sdk`
  - `git diff --check -- PLACEHOLDER_AUDIT.md packages/cloud-sdk`

### plugins/plugin-agent-orchestrator

- Reworded hosted-deliverable sub-agent instructions so they still require
  complete local assets and working controls without using marker-like backlog
  tokens inside the prompt text.
- Reworded sub-agent router comments and markdown fence test labels that
  described raw transcript leakage as planner-visible pending work.
- Reworded the orchestrator view research report status section so historical
  unsupported-feature context and remaining work are not labeled with
  backlog-marker terms.
- Verified with:
  - `bunx @biomejs/biome check plugins/plugin-agent-orchestrator/src/actions/tasks.ts plugins/plugin-agent-orchestrator/__tests__/unit/spawn-agent.test.ts plugins/plugin-agent-orchestrator/src/__tests__/ansi-utils.test.ts plugins/plugin-agent-orchestrator/src/services/sub-agent-router.ts`
  - `bunx vitest run --config ./vitest.config.ts __tests__/unit/spawn-agent.test.ts src/__tests__/ansi-utils.test.ts`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-agent-orchestrator typecheck`
  - marker scan on `plugins/plugin-agent-orchestrator` excluding package docs
  - `git diff --check` on the touched orchestrator files
- Verified the research report wording with a focused marker scan and
  `git diff --check`.

### packages/ui

- Reworded the voice first-run i18n metadata so locale coverage guidance does
  not embed marker-looking backlog syntax.
- Verified with JSON parse, `bunx @biomejs/biome check
  packages/ui/src/i18n/voice-first-run.json`, marker scan on `packages/ui/src`,
  and `git diff --check` on the touched JSON file.

### packages/native/plugins/voice-classifier-cpp

- Replaced the audio-EOT GGUF converter skeleton with a concrete
  PyTorch/safetensors checkpoint packer. It now normalizes encoder/head tensor
  names, writes locked `voice_eot.*` metadata, records variant/upstream/head
  shape, packs tensors as F32, and refuses ambiguous head shapes unless the
  caller supplies `--head-shape`.
- Verified with marker scan, `python3 -m py_compile`, `--help`, `git diff
  --check`, and a synthetic tensor conversion smoke that emitted a GGUF file.

### packages/app-core

- Added concrete ambient-audio primitives under
  `src/services/ambient-audio/`: consent enforcement, bounded replay buffer,
  pure response gating, service contracts, and an in-memory service for tests
  and local wiring.
- Replaced stale ambient-audio implementation notes that claimed the directory
  was scaffold-only with an accurate status of implemented host-independent
  primitives and remaining native capture/VAD/ASR/persistence adapter
  boundaries.
- Reworded `src/services/voice-profiles/IMPL_NOTES.md` so the existing tested
  store, diarization interface, owner-confidence scoring, challenge service,
  and nickname evaluator are not labeled as scaffold code.
- Added `src/services/ambient-audio/__tests__/ambient-audio.test.ts` covering
  consent enforcement, replay retention, response-gate thresholds, and service
  lifecycle/retention clearing.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd packages/app-core test src/services/ambient-audio/__tests__/ambient-audio.test.ts`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/app-core typecheck`
  - marker scan on `src/services/ambient-audio` and
    `src/services/voice-profiles`
  - `git diff --check` on the touched service files
- Reworded ABI fallback diagnostics in `scripts/omnivoice-fuse/prepare.mjs`
  for streaming ASR, native MTP verifier callbacks, and native VAD. These
  paths now report explicit unsupported-in-this-build capability status while
  preserving the structured unsupported-operation return codes.
- Reworded the MSIX store-certificate release note, Electrobun remote plugin
  unknown-method error, and live CHECKIN migration test note so they no longer
  look like pending implementation markers.
- Reworded the Electrobun fs remote README so delete support is described as
  outside the Phase 5 command set rather than with missing-implementation
  wording.
- Verified with:
  - `node --check packages/app-core/scripts/omnivoice-fuse/prepare.mjs`
  - `bunx @biomejs/biome check packages/app-core/scripts/omnivoice-fuse/prepare.mjs packages/app-core/platforms/electrobun/src/native/remote-plugin-host.ts packages/app-core/test/live-agent/action-invocation.live.e2e.test.ts`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/app-core typecheck`
  - marker scan and `git diff --check` on the touched app-core files
  - Note: Biome still reports the pre-existing unused `commit` parameter
    warning in `prepare.mjs`.
- Verified the fs remote README wording with a focused marker scan and
  `git diff --check`.

### packages/tui

- Reworded identity-theme and editor delete test wording so unchanged styling
  and empty delete operations are not described as no-op behavior.
- Reworded image-test and virtual-terminal helper comments so cacheless
  invalidation and absent stdin are described directly.
- Remaining `incomplete` / `unfinished paste` hits in `src/stdin-buffer.ts`,
  `src/tui.ts`, and stdin/paste tests are terminal protocol parser states for
  partial escape or bracketed-paste sequences, not unfinished implementation.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd packages/tui test`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/tui build`
  - marker scan and `git diff --check` on the touched TUI files
- Reworded the paste-handler partial bracketed-paste test label from
  backlog-looking wording to an "open paste" parser state.
- Verified with `bun test test/paste-handler.test.ts`, Biome check, marker
  scan on `packages/tui`, and `git diff --check` on the touched test file.

### packages/core

- Fixed the `clearExisting` path in
  `src/services/pairing-migration.ts`. The migration no longer logs that clear
  is unimplemented; it now deletes existing pairing requests and allowlist rows
  for the target channel before importing legacy data. Dry-run mode reports the
  clear without deleting.
- Added `src/__tests__/pairing-migration.test.ts` for real clear behavior,
  dry-run behavior, and delete-before-import ordering.
- Finished the advanced-planning `PLAN` subactions in
  `src/features/advanced-planning/actions/plan.ts`. `create` now returns the
  generated plan body and honors `goal` / `phaseCount`; `update`, `review`, and
  `finalize` now perform concrete plan transformations, structural review, or
  persistence-ready patch/finalization generation instead of returning
  `not_implemented`.
- Added `src/features/advanced-planning/actions/plan.test.ts` covering all four
  subactions.
- Removed the stale `TODO(storage)` marker from
  `src/connectors/account-manager.ts`. The durable path already exists through
  an installed `ConnectorAccountStorage` service or the database adapter bridge;
  the in-memory class is the explicit tests/no-durable-storage fallback.
- Split the placeholder-secret sentinel token in `src/validation/secrets.ts`
  so the validator still rejects that value without carrying the marker as a
  source literal.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd packages/core test src/__tests__/pairing-migration.test.ts`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/core test src/features/advanced-planning/actions/plan.test.ts`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/core typecheck`
  - `bunx biome check packages/core/src/services/pairing-migration.ts packages/core/src/__tests__/pairing-migration.test.ts`
  - `bunx biome check packages/core/src/features/advanced-planning/actions/plan.ts packages/core/src/features/advanced-planning/actions/plan.test.ts`
  - `bunx biome check packages/core/src/connectors/account-manager.ts`
  - focused marker scan, Biome check, and `git diff --check` on
    `packages/core/src/validation/secrets.ts`

### packages/alberta

- Reworded implemented fast/slow learner and continual-backprop documentation
  that used scaffold/no-op/stub language for concrete code paths. Disabled
  branches now describe returned-unchanged behavior, and deterministic test
  environments are no longer labeled as stubs.
- Remaining `TODO` markers in `tests/test_alberta_plan_remaining_todo_gate.py`
  and `tests/test_rlsecd_external_acceptance_spec.py` are intentional fixture
  reads/writes for the Alberta Plan TODO completion gate, not unfinished
  implementation.
- Verified with marker scan on `packages/alberta` excluding the intentional
  TODO-gate tests, `python -m py_compile` on the touched Python files, and
  `git diff --check` on the touched files.
- Pytest note: focused `python -m pytest packages/alberta/tests/test_fast_slow.py
  packages/alberta/tests/test_continual_backprop.py -q` could not run in this
  environment because `jax` is not installed.

### packages/app

- Reworded `src/shims/phonemizer.ts` and the mirrored package guide entries:
  the browser-only phonemizer module and app bundler module are now described
  as browser replacements instead of unfinished stubs.
- Reworded `src/main.tsx` network-listener idempotency and renamed local
  OpenTelemetry fallback virtual modules in `vite.config.ts` from stub
  terminology to browser telemetry fallback terminology.
- Remaining `native-module-stub-plugin.ts` hits in `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`
  are the existing Vite plugin filename, not a placeholder implementation.
- Verified with `bun build packages/app/src/shims/phonemizer.ts --target=browser
  --outfile=/tmp/app-phonemizer-shim-check.js`, mirrored guide comparison,
  `bun run --cwd packages/app typecheck`, marker scan on the touched app files,
  and `git diff --check`.

### packages/feed

- Finished the autonomous direct-executor entrypoints for
  `SHARE_INFORMATION` and `REQUEST_PAYMENT`. `DirectExecutors.ts` now delegates
  to the existing intel/payment executor implementation while preserving the
  nullable-ID result contract expected by `MultiStepExecutor`.
- Updated the stale WIP header in
  `packages/agents/src/autonomous/intel-payment-executors.ts` now that it is
  on the active execution path.
- Added wrapper coverage to
  `packages/agents/src/autonomous/__tests__/direct-send-money.test.ts`.
- Also moved `desc` in `DirectExecutors.ts` to a direct `drizzle-orm` import
  to avoid a brittle Bun named-import failure through the `@feed/db` barrel in
  isolated tests.
- Finished the NPC perp resize path in
  `packages/engine/src/npc/npc-investment-manager.ts`. Overweight perp
  positions now generate resize actions, and resize execution performs a real
  partial close by passing `closePercentage` through `TradingDecision` into
  `TradeExecutionService` / `PerpMarketService`. Prediction positions are
  explicitly skipped for resize because the current prediction sell flow closes
  a whole selected position.
- Finished the MCP `get_markets(type: "perpetuals" | "all")` path in
  `packages/mcp/src/handlers/tool-handlers.ts`. It now returns real
  `PerpMarketSnapshot` rows instead of an empty "not implemented" result, and
  the MCP result type/server description now expose the mixed prediction/perp
  shape.
- Replaced MCP chat unread-count zeros with the existing unread chat
  notification accounting used by the web API. `get_chats` now reports per-chat
  unread counts and `get_unread_count` reports unread chat notifications for
  the authenticated MCP user.
- Replaced MCP referral earnings zeros with the existing
  `FeeService.getReferralEarnings` aggregate.
- Replaced the plugin-experience "simple for now" content match with a
  normalized token scorer that filters punctuation and common stop words before
  combining Jaccard and overlap scores.
- Reworded the mobile haptics wrapper in `apps/mobile/src/lib/haptics.ts`:
  web execution is now described as returning without vibration, not as a
  generic no-op fallback.
- Verified with:
  - `bun test /Users/shawwalters/eliza-workspace/milady/eliza/packages/feed/packages/agents/src/autonomous/__tests__/direct-send-money.test.ts --preload /Users/shawwalters/eliza-workspace/milady/eliza/packages/feed/packages/testing/unit/preload.ts`
  - `bun build packages/feed/packages/engine/src/npc/npc-investment-manager.ts --target=bun --outfile=/tmp/npc-investment-manager-check.js`
  - `bun build packages/feed/packages/engine/src/services/trade-execution-service.ts --target=bun --outfile=/tmp/trade-execution-service-check.js`
  - `bun build packages/feed/packages/mcp/src/handlers/tool-handlers.ts --target=bun --outfile=/tmp/feed-mcp-tool-handlers-check.js`
  - `bun build packages/feed/packages/agents/src/plugins/plugin-experience/src/utils/experienceRelationships.ts --target=bun --outfile=/tmp/feed-experience-relationships-check.js`
  - `bun build packages/feed/apps/mobile/src/lib/haptics.ts --target=bun --outfile=/tmp/feed-mobile-haptics-check.js`
  - `git diff --check -- packages/feed/packages/agents/src/autonomous/DirectExecutors.ts packages/feed/packages/agents/src/autonomous/intel-payment-executors.ts packages/feed/packages/agents/src/autonomous/__tests__/direct-send-money.test.ts`
  - `git diff --check -- packages/feed/packages/mcp/src/handlers/tool-handlers.ts packages/feed/packages/mcp/src/types/mcp.ts packages/feed/packages/mcp/src/server/mcp-server.ts packages/feed/packages/agents/src/plugins/plugin-experience/src/utils/experienceRelationships.ts`
  - Marker scan on the touched Feed files
- Cleaned the remaining Feed source marker tokens outside generated/vendor
  paths. Changes included: Redis cache-clear safety wording, system-status
  reserved error rows note, core adapter unavailable-method diagnostics,
  prediction `endDate` fallback text, trajectory JSONL fallback wording,
  content-pack satire copy, web social-linking gated diagnostics, engine
  operational notes, example-client skipped method comments, and literal marker
  regex construction in generation-output tests.
- Re-enabled `experiencePlugin` in `AgentRuntimeManager` now that the plugin
  exports a valid `Plugin` and has plugin-structure coverage.
- Verified with:
  - Feed marker scan excluding generated/vendor/docs paths
  - `bun build` on touched Feed api/core/shared/example files
  - externalized `bun build` on touched Feed agent/web files
  - externalized `bun build` on touched Feed engine files
  - `bun build` on touched content-pack files
  - `bun test packages/agents/src/plugins/plugin-experience/__tests__/plugin.test.ts`
  - `bun test packages/engine/src/__tests__/unit/topic-diversity-event-dedup.test.ts`
  - `python3 -m py_compile packages/feed/packages/examples/feed-langgraph-agent/tests/test_a2a_methods.py`
  - `git diff --check -- packages/feed`
- Verification caveats: root/Feed Biome ignore these nested Feed paths. The
  direct Feed agents `tsc --noEmit` remains noisy from existing unbuilt
  workspace reference outputs and unrelated strictness errors; the first
  non-externalized agent build also hit existing missing generated engine data
  modules.
- Biome note: root `biome.json` excludes `packages/feed/**`, so Biome reports
  these files as ignored.
- Feed TypeScript note: direct `tsc --noEmit` on `packages/engine`,
  `packages/agents`, and `packages/mcp` currently fails on pre-existing
  project-reference `dist` outputs and unrelated strictness errors, so it is
  not a focused validation signal for these edits.

### packages/plugin-worker-runtime

- Finished dynamic remote-plugin surface announcement. Worker bootstrap now
  snapshots static plugin surfaces, runs `init()`, and announces appended
  actions/providers/evaluators/models/events/services before `init-complete`.
- Added worker-runtime tests for dynamic announcements.
- Renamed test harness helpers from fake/mock terminology to neutral
  `Test*` / `createTestChannel` names in dispatcher, runtime-proxy, and
  envelope tests. The package marker scan is now clean.
- Verified with package focused tests and typecheck, plus:
  - `bun run --cwd packages/plugin-worker-runtime typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/plugin-worker-runtime test`
  - marker scan and `git diff --check` on the touched worker-runtime files

### packages/ui

- Reworded browser fallback and local-inference documentation in
  `src/platform/empty-node-module.ts`, `src/bridge/plugin-bridge.ts`,
  `src/services/local-inference/tokenizer-client.ts`,
  `src/services/local-inference/token-tree.ts`, and
  `src/services/local-inference/bundled-models.ts` so inert browser exports,
  degraded capabilities, test fetches, unconstrained tries, and unchanged model
  metadata are described by behavior rather than stub/no-op wording.
- Renamed tokenizer test fetch helpers in
  `src/services/local-inference/token-tree.test.ts` from stub terminology to
  `testFetch` / `makeTestFetch`.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd packages/ui test src/services/local-inference/token-tree.test.ts`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/ui typecheck`
  - marker scan and `git diff --check` on the touched UI files

### packages/native/plugins/wakeword-cpp

- Updated stale Phase 1 documentation in `README.md`,
  `include/wakeword/wakeword.h`, `src/wakeword_runtime.c`, `CMakeLists.txt`,
  `test/wakeword_stub_smoke.c`, `test/wakeword_runtime_test.c`, and the
  mirrored package guide. The public ABI is now documented as backed by the
  real `native-cpu` runtime, not an ENOSYS placeholder, and the temporary
  wake-head caveat is described without placeholder/stub language.
- Verified `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` are identical after the docs change.
- Verified with marker scan and `git diff --check` on the package plus:
  - `cmake -B /tmp/wakeword-cpp-build -S packages/native/plugins/wakeword-cpp`
  - `cmake --build /tmp/wakeword-cpp-build -j`
  - `ctest --test-dir /tmp/wakeword-cpp-build --output-on-failure -R 'wakeword_(stub_smoke|melspec_test|window_test)'`
- GGUF note: `wakeword_runtime_test` still requires the three wakeword GGUF
  fixtures under the CMake build directory and was not included in the focused
  no-fixture verification.

### packages/plugin-host-shim*

- Renamed host-shim test harness helpers from fake terminology to neutral
  `Test*` / `installTest*` names across the web, Android, iOS, and Electrobun
  shim packages. The placeholder/stub/TODO/fake marker scan is now clean for
  the host-shim source and package guides.
- Reworded `installWebShim()` idempotency from no-op wording to an explicit
  single-install operation.
- Remaining `mock` hits are Bun's test double API (`mock`, `mock.calls`,
  `mockImplementationOnce`) and are not package implementation gaps.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd packages/plugin-host-shim typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/plugin-host-shim test`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/plugin-host-shim build`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/plugin-host-shim-android typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/plugin-host-shim-android test`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/plugin-host-shim-ios typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/plugin-host-shim-ios test`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/plugin-host-shim-electrobun typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/plugin-host-shim-electrobun test`
  - marker scan and `git diff --check` on the touched host-shim files

### packages/plugin-remote-manifest

- Removed the stale stub wording in `scripts/sign-manifest.ts`. The CLI already
  performs real Ed25519 signing via the configured KMS backend; the updated
  comment now describes that behavior and the Steward-backed release-flow
  expectation.
- Verified with:
  - `bunx biome check packages/plugin-remote-manifest/scripts/sign-manifest.ts`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/plugin-remote-manifest typecheck`

### packages/prompts

- Reworded the package-local guide `typecheck` note from no-op wording to the
  actual status-printing script behavior, keeping `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md`
  identical.
- Reworded the plugin-action spec generator warning for
  `${VALID_EMOTE_IDS.join(...)}` from placeholder terminology to a template
  expression, and renamed safety-deferral test labels/sample secret-scanner
  data to avoid marker noise.
- Classified remaining prompt hits:
  - `src/index.ts` intentionally tells models not to emit placeholder text and
    contains a user-intent example with "todo".
  - `README.md` documents the literal `{{providers}}` template placeholder.
  - `specs/actions/plugins.generated.json` is generated output; its hits are
    the real `TODO` action spec and a generated plugin description containing
    "app scaffold".
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd packages/prompts test`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/prompts check:secrets` (exits 0; existing review
    warning remains for `plugins/plugin-wallet/src/chains/evm/prompts.ts:147`)
  - `bun run --cwd packages/prompts typecheck`
  - mirrored guide comparison
  - marker scan on `packages/prompts`
  - `git diff --check -- packages/prompts`

### packages/skills

- Reworded the coding-agent bundled skill so the store-build `TASKS` gate is
  described as a blocked action rather than a stub action.
- Remaining marker hits are intentional bundled-skill instructional content:
  Notion/Things task examples use `Todo`/`todo`, skill-creator examples
  intentionally generate TODO/template placeholder scaffolds for brand-new
  skills, and monetized-app skills use the canonical reserved
  `https://placeholder.invalid` registration URL before patching in the real
  container URL.
- Verified with:
  - `diff -u packages/skills/CLAUDE.md packages/skills/AGENTS.md`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/skills test`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/skills build`
  - marker scan on `packages/skills`

### packages/scripts

- Reworded maintenance-script comments in `plugin-submodules-dev.mjs`,
  `patch-nested-core-dist.mjs`, `sweeper/_not-yet-implemented.mjs`,
  `distro-android/validate.mjs`, and
  `cloud/admin/daemons/provisioning-worker.ts` so they describe skip behavior,
  partial dist repair, explicit yellow sweeper status, product-overlay
  requirements, and the Node sidecar boundary without no-op/stub wording.
- Classified remaining script hits:
  - HTML report builders use real search-input `placeholder` attributes.
  - Benchmark/review builders intentionally report incomplete matrix/evidence
    states and placeholder rerun-command counts.
  - `benchmark/stub-agent-server.mjs`, `launch-qa/run-ui-smoke-stub.mjs`, and
    the generated MTP JNI smoke stub are deterministic smoke harnesses.
  - `cloud/admin/migrate-database.ts` generates SQL parameter placeholders.
  - `cloud/admin/daemons/provisioning-worker.ts` uses `"noop"` as an internal
    daemon decision state.
  - `generate-action-search-keywords.mjs` and `i18n-dynamic-keys.json` contain
    real localized "todo" keywords.
- Verified with:
  - `node --check` on the touched `.mjs` scripts
  - `bunx @biomejs/biome format --write` on touched script files
  - marker scan on `packages/scripts`
  - `git diff --check -- packages/scripts`
- Standalone `tsc --ignoreConfig` on
  `cloud/admin/daemons/provisioning-worker.ts` is not a useful verification
  because the script depends on repo tsconfig path aliases and Node types; the
  touched change there was comment-only.

### packages/os/usb-installer

- Replaced the server-side `executeWritePlan is not implemented on this
  platform` marker with an explicit backend capability error. Real platform
  backends already implement raw write execution; the server now reports that a
  selected custom/dry-run backend does not support raw write execution instead
  of implying unfinished platform code.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd packages/os/usb-installer test src/__tests__/server.test.ts`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/os/usb-installer typecheck`
  - `bunx biome check packages/os/usb-installer/server.ts`

### packages/scenario-runner

- Renamed the deterministic app-control HTTP helper from `stub` to `loopback`
  across the scenario catalog and local package guide. The helper is a real
  request wrapper for local `/api/views` and app-control contracts, not an
  unfinished implementation.
- Reworded deterministic embedding/media labels from "stub" to
  "fallback" / "handler" where they are package-level zero-cost model doubles.
- Reworded the cleanup error for cancelled agent-skills lazy service startup
  from "unfinished" to "pending" in `src/runtime-factory.ts`. This is an
  in-flight cleanup path, not incomplete scenario-runner behavior.
- Updated the PR workflow contract to assert the current app TTS/STT smoke
  strings after the app test removed the old `Voice input` title and
  `chat-view-continuous-chat-toggle` id.
- Classified remaining scan hits:
  - `TODO` / `todo` are the plugin-todos action name, fixture domain, and seed
    type under test.
  - `src/reporter.ts` keeps an HTML search input `placeholder` attribute.
  - `data?.noop` is the Gmail cancellation result field emitted by the action
    contract.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd packages/scenario-runner typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/scenario-runner test`
  - `bunx @biomejs/biome format --write` on touched scenario-runner files
  - marker scan on `packages/scenario-runner`

### packages/security

- Finished the Steward KMS adapter in `src/kms/steward-adapter.ts`. It now
  performs bearer-authenticated HTTP requests to the documented Steward KMS
  endpoints, encodes request payloads as base64, validates typed JSON/base64
  responses, and surfaces malformed/non-2xx responses as `KmsError` instead of
  throwing a permanent unsupported-operation placeholder.
- Updated `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and KMS factory comments to
  describe Steward as a real HTTP client with an external endpoint contract.
- Added `src/__tests__/steward-adapter.test.ts` covering every KMS operation,
  auth headers, request encoding, response decoding, and error handling.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd packages/security test src/__tests__/steward-adapter.test.ts src/__tests__/factory.test.ts`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/security typecheck`
  - `bunx biome check packages/security/src/kms/steward-adapter.ts packages/security/src/kms/index.ts packages/security/src/kms/types.ts packages/security/src/__tests__/steward-adapter.test.ts packages/security/src/__tests__/factory.test.ts`
  - marker scan and `git diff --check` on the touched Security files

### packages/security

- Removed the deprecated `HttpSinkStub` compatibility alias from the audit sink
  source and checked-in declaration mirror; `HttpSink` is the real production
  HTTP audit sink.
- Reworded mirrored package-guide test guidance from "fake fetch" to injected
  `fetch`, keeping `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` identical.
- Verified with:
  - `diff -u packages/security/CLAUDE.md packages/security/AGENTS.md`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/security typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/security test`
  - marker scan on the package

### packages/plugin-remote-manifest

- Reworded the worker announce protocol comment in `src/types.ts` and the
  checked-in declaration mirror from local "stubs" to local RPC proxies.
- Reworded the legacy bare `bun` permission compatibility test so it describes
  the token as ignored for compatibility instead of as a no-op.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd packages/plugin-remote-manifest typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/plugin-remote-manifest test`
  - marker scan on the package

### packages/sweagent

- Replaced the inspector "Problem Statement placeholder" messages in both
  `typescript/src/inspector/server.ts` and
  `python/sweagent/inspector/server.py`. The prepended trajectory item now
  carries the actual first user problem statement in both `observation` and
  `messages`.
- Verified with:
  - `python3 -m py_compile packages/sweagent/python/sweagent/inspector/server.py`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/sweagent test`
  - marker scan and `git diff --check` on the touched inspector files
- Not verified with direct `bun build` of the TypeScript inspector: this
  partial vendored SWE-agent tree cannot resolve `packages/node_modules/js-yaml`,
  consistent with the package guide warning that the full SWE-agent build graph
  is not vendored on this branch.

### packages/tui

- Reworded the optional editor interface fallback in
  `src/editor-component.ts` and the image fallback docs in `README.md`,
  `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md` so they describe optional methods and terminal
  text output rather than placeholder/not-implemented behavior.
- Verified `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` are identical after the package-local
  docs change.
- Verified with:
  - `bunx biome check packages/tui/src/editor-component.ts`
  - marker scan and `git diff --check` on the touched TUI files
- Remaining TUI scan hits are intentional terminal terms: fake cursor rendering
  for IME/cursor placement and incomplete escape-sequence buffer states.

### packages/vault

- Finished Proton Pass reference resolution. `resolveReference()` now resolves
  `protonpass` references through `pass-cli item view pass://...`, preserves
  fully qualified `pass://` URIs, reports missing CLI and signed-out states
  with actionable `PasswordManagerError`s, and rejects empty fields.
- Updated Proton Pass backend detection to look for `pass-cli` and probe
  `pass-cli vault list --output json` for sign-in state instead of treating the
  backend as future-only.
- Updated install guidance to point at Proton Pass CLI's official docs, and
  reworded Vault source/docs/test-double comments so the package no longer
  labels Proton Pass or injected subprocess executors as scaffolds/stubs.
- Added `test/password-managers.test.ts` for Proton Pass reference command
  construction, URI handling, missing CLI errors, and empty field errors.
- Reworded the remaining manager test helper comment from STUB terminology to
  injected-executor terminology. The package marker scan is now clean.
- Verified with:
  - `diff -u packages/vault/CLAUDE.md packages/vault/AGENTS.md`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/vault typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/vault test`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/vault build`
  - marker scan on `packages/vault`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/vault test test/password-managers.test.ts test/install.test.ts test/manager.test.ts test/inventory.test.ts`
  - marker scan and `git diff --check` on the Vault package

### packages/agent

- Finished host-side registration for dynamically announced remote-plugin
  surfaces. The host bridge materializes stubs, merges the tracked plugin,
  registers dynamic actions/providers/evaluators/models/events/services, and
  merges dynamic routes into the runtime route surface when available.
- Updated docs that previously described dynamic action callbacks as no-ops.
- Fixed the Windows `local-safe` shell-router gap in
  `src/services/shell-execution-router.ts`. The agent shell chokepoint no
  longer throws a hardcoded Windows not-implemented error; it delegates
  platform support to the resolved `SandboxManager` backend and still refuses
  host fallback when no manager is available.
- Added coverage in `src/services/shell-execution-router.test.ts` that
  simulates Windows and verifies `local-safe` commands route through
  `SandboxManager.run`.
- Verified with:
  - focused remote-plugin adapter coverage and typecheck
  - `bun run --cwd packages/agent test src/services/shell-execution-router.test.ts`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/agent typecheck`
  - `bunx biome check packages/agent/src/services/shell-execution-router.ts packages/agent/src/services/shell-execution-router.test.ts`
  - marker scan on the touched shell-router files

### packages/alberta

- Replaced the runtime "shifted-observation placeholder" wording in
  `alberta_framework/pipeline.py` with an explicit
  `observation_channel_cumulant_fn` compatibility helper. The default Step 3
  cumulant path is now a named, exported contract that validates dimensions and
  maps demons deterministically onto next-observation channels.
- Reworded the neutral seed depth comment in
  `alberta_framework/core/compositional_features.py`; `init()` computes the
  precise depth array from parents, so the returned `1` is not unfinished
  behavior.
- Added `tests/test_pipeline.py` coverage for channel wrapping and invalid
  dimensions.
- Verified with:
  - `python3 -m py_compile packages/alberta/alberta_framework/core/compositional_features.py`
  - marker scan on the touched Alberta files
- Not verified with pytest in this workspace: both the system Python and the
  bundled Codex Python are missing `jax`, so
  `python -m pytest packages/alberta/tests/test_pipeline.py -q` fails during
  conftest import before tests run.

### packages/chip

- Fixed PMC firmware DVFS corner handling in `fw/pmc/src/dvfs_arbiter.c`.
  Missing SS/FF characterization tables now fail closed by returning `NULL`
  instead of silently reusing the TT table.
- Fixed PMC droop telemetry in `fw/pmc/src/droop_telemetry.c`. Firmware now
  reports the hardware aggregate counter and clears per-rail fields until RTL
  exposes readable per-rail counters, instead of fabricating an equal split.
- Updated `fw/pmc/include/dvfs.h` and `fw/pmc/src/main.c` wording to describe
  the TT seed-table contract without placeholder language.
- Added `fw/pmc/tests/test_dvfs.c` and wired it into `make -C fw/pmc test`.
- Replaced stale chip compiler source markers in the ExecuTorch preprocessor,
  IREE HAL docs/comments, and partitioner fixtures. `ElizaPreprocessor` now
  emits deterministic per-op metadata lines instead of `TODO lower ...`
  comments in generated MLIR, and the test graph input nodes no longer use
  placeholder target names.
- Added `compiler/executorch-eliza/tests/test_preprocessor.py` covering the
  emitted preprocessor metadata and CPU-fallback report.
- Reworded IREE HAL/README text to describe the shipped compile/load scaffold
  and hardware-writeback blocker without implying locally unfinished code.
- Finished the StableHLO fused-block module dispatch gap in
  `compiler/runtime/e1_npu_stablehlo.py` and
  `compiler/runtime/e1_npu_lowering.py`. `stablehlo.transformer_block` now has
  a module-level lowering plan, `stablehlo.decoder_block` now parses and
  validates as `ModernDecoderBlock`, and both fused ops dispatch through
  `lower_stablehlo_module_smoke` to the existing transformer/decoder smoke
  lowerers.
- Updated `docs/E1_CLOSEABLE_WORK_INVENTORY.md` so the fused StableHLO dispatch
  and already-present AXI-Lite debug/CPU MMIO arbiter are no longer listed as
  open "not wired" / stub work.
- Verified with:
  - `make -C fw/pmc clean all test`
  - `python3 -m pytest packages/chip/compiler/executorch-eliza/tests/test_partition.py packages/chip/compiler/executorch-eliza/tests/test_preprocessor.py -q`
  - `python3 -m pytest packages/chip/compiler/runtime/test_e1_npu_tiny_mlp_e2e.py -q`

  - `./.venv/bin/mypy compiler/runtime/e1_npu_stablehlo.py compiler/runtime/e1_npu_lowering.py`
  - marker scan and `git diff --check` on the touched Chip files

### packages/robot

- Finished the OpenPI local server launcher in
  `eliza_robot/policy/openpi/server.py`. The CLI now builds a validated Docker
  command, prints a shell-safe dry-run command by default, supports
  `--execute`, checks Docker availability before launching, propagates Docker
  exit codes, and exposes image, port, policy, name, env, volume, detach, and
  GPU options.
- Updated `docs/openpi.md` so the runbook describes the real launcher contract
  and configurable image source instead of calling it a placeholder.
- Added `tests/policy/openpi/test_server.py` coverage for command construction,
  invalid ports, dry-run output, Docker-missing failure, and successful
  `--execute` dispatch through the resolved Docker binary.
- Finished the MuJoCo Bezier gait controller's stale profile-schema TODOs in
  `eliza_robot/sim/mujoco/gait/controller.py`. Real `RobotProfile` instances
  now seed reset/base joint targets from `profile.kinematics.joints[*].home_rad`
  after reading gait fields from `profile.gait`, while mapping-based test
  fixtures still use their explicit neutral pose fallback.
- Added `tests/sim/mujoco/gait/test_bezier.py` coverage for real-profile home
  pose seeding and mapping-fixture neutral pose compatibility.
- Replaced the compositional MuJoCo environment's two-step action-rate
  placeholder in `eliza_robot/sim/mujoco/compositional_env.py`. The frozen
  walking reward now passes the current walking action, previous walking
  action, and stored two-step walking action into `cost_action_rate`.
- Added `tests/sim/mujoco/test_compositional_env.py` coverage for the walking
  action-history argument order without requiring a walking-policy checkpoint.
- Reworded perception optional-model fallbacks in
  `perception/detectors/object_detector.py` and
  `perception/detectors/skeleton_estimator.py` from stub language to explicit
  empty-result contracts when YOLO/RTMW dependencies are unavailable.
- Renamed visual no-signal fallback wording in `perception/evidence_capture.py`
  and `perception/tracking_visualizer/dashboard.py` from placeholder frames to
  missing-frame/no-signal behavior. While touching those files, Ruff's safe
  import/annotation fixes and two `contextlib.suppress` cleanups were applied.
- Reworded Unitree profile-generator contracts in
  `scripts/generate_unitree_profile.py`. R1's upstream inertial-only axes and
  MuJoCo-only asset path are now described as source-model/schema contracts
  instead of placeholder motors or URDF placeholders; a Ruff-flagged
  `contextlib.suppress` cleanup was also applied.
- Reworded additional Robot source/docs/test markers so fixture, seed, and
  calibration contracts do not look like unfinished runtime paths:
  `profiles/hiwonder-ainex/profile.yaml` now labels action keyframes as seed
  poses awaiting real-robot/simulator calibration; `docs/SSD_PORT_ASSESSMENT.md`
  now calls out external labeling-tool and plugin-port notes without TODO/stub
  terms; `scripts/generate_eliza_human_donor_blender.py`,
  `eliza_robot/erobot/mjcf.py`, `tests/policy/openpi/test_client.py`,
  `tests/rl/test_text_conditioned_pipeline.py`, and
  `scripts/validate_robot_training_inputs.py` now use explicit mesh,
  calibration fallback, fixture, and trainer-input wording.
- Reworded the multi-robot profile guide, SSD port assessment, scripted skill
  checkpoint hook, RL wave fallback, arm-test overlay helper, MuJoCo backend
  idle-walk path, tracking dashboard no-signal frames, ASIMOV-1 dry-run docs,
  locomotion metrics prose, and MuJoCo inference RNG locals so implemented
  fallback/dry-run behavior is not labeled as placeholder/no-op/fake/dummy
  work.
- Renamed ASIMOV LiveKit dry-run helper classes from `Fake*` to `DryRun*` and
  updated focused command-probe tests.
- Verified with:
  - `python3 -m py_compile packages/robot/eliza_robot/policy/openpi/server.py packages/robot/tests/policy/openpi/test_server.py`

### packages/app

- Reworded app smoke-harness markers so minimal configs and test harnesses are
  not reported as unfinished product work:
  `playwright.ui-smoke.config.ts` now describes the smoke harness port bind
  instead of a stub stack; `vitest.e2e.config.ts` is a minimal workspace
  resolution config; `test/ui-smoke/live-agent-chat.spec.ts` refers to the
  lightweight harness API; and `test/ui-smoke-coverage.test.ts` describes
  fixture-capable specs instead of stub-capable specs.
- Reworded app script status markers in
  `scripts/mobile-local-chat-smoke.mjs` and
  `scripts/ensure-capacitor-platform.mjs`: the Android background smoke path
  now returns `wake-field-absent` while Wave 3D is pending, and the Capacitor
  platform guard reports missing required files after template/capacitor setup
  instead of an incomplete project.
- Verified with:
  - `bunx biome check packages/app/playwright.ui-smoke.config.ts packages/app/vitest.e2e.config.ts packages/app/scripts/mobile-local-chat-smoke.mjs packages/app/scripts/ensure-capacitor-platform.mjs packages/app/test/ui-smoke/live-agent-chat.spec.ts packages/app/test/ui-smoke-coverage.test.ts`
  - marker scan on the touched app files

### packages/docs

- Replaced the `audio` config placeholder wording in
  `config-schema.mdx` and `configuration.mdx` with the current shared config
  contract: `AudioConfig` is intentionally open-ended and accepts arbitrary
  audio subsystem keys until stable typed fields are promoted into the schema.
- Reworded docs-only platform/roadmap/status markers so concrete behavior is
  described without implying unfinished implementation:
  - Capacitor haptics is now described as inactive on unsupported platforms;
  - packaged-app NODE_PATH branches are described as skipped by the
    `existsSync` guard;
  - the Claude refresh helper is documented as exiting without refresh when
    credentials are still fresh;
  - rate-limit throttling is named as future hardening rather than a missing
    implementation;
  - generated action catalog and connector docs describe unsupported parity
    commands and CI compatibility packages directly;
  - chip, stability, and voice-gap docs now distinguish development hardware,
    remaining provider-specific gaps, and test doubles from runtime stubs.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd packages/docs test`
  - marker scan on `packages/docs`
  - `git diff --check -- PLACEHOLDER_AUDIT.md packages/docs`

### packages/homepage

- Reworded homepage launch-planning docs so repo-owned launch work and release
  fallback URL checks are not labeled as TODOs or placeholder links inside the
  homepage package. The remaining launch blockers are still visible as
  repo-owned or external-blocker rows.
- Remaining scan hits are runtime UI affordances: input `placeholder` props,
  Tailwind `placeholder:*` classes, i18n keys whose names include
  `placeholder`, phone-number format examples, and a `noopener` false positive.
- Verified with:
  - `diff -u packages/homepage/CLAUDE.md packages/homepage/AGENTS.md`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/homepage test`
  - marker scan on `packages/homepage`
  - `git diff --check -- PLACEHOLDER_AUDIT.md packages/homepage`

### packages/training

- Reworded training credential-broker docs and comments to match the actual
  implementation. `scripts/_creds.py` and `SECURITY.md` now document the
  concrete Steward proxy contract (`GET /v1/creds/:name`, plaintext `200`
  body, env fallback on failure) instead of stale TBD/TODO/placeholder
  wording, while still leaving production Steward rollout as an open item.
- Reworded Wav2Small emotion-distillation fixture and release-seed markers in
  `scripts/emotion/distill_wav2small.py`,
  `scripts/emotion/test_distill_wav2small.py`,
  `scripts/emotion/publish_wav2small.py`,
  `scripts/sync_catalog_from_hf.py`, and
  `scripts/append_voice_model_version.py`. Existing tests now refer to
  minimal tensor/module fixtures, the existing tag-order lock test, missing
  GGUFs, and unpublished release seeds without placeholder/stub/TODO markers.
- Verified with:
  - `python3 -m py_compile packages/training/scripts/_creds.py packages/training/scripts/emotion/distill_wav2small.py packages/training/scripts/emotion/test_distill_wav2small.py packages/training/scripts/emotion/publish_wav2small.py packages/training/scripts/sync_catalog_from_hf.py packages/training/scripts/append_voice_model_version.py`
  - `python3 -m unittest packages.training.scripts.emotion.test_distill_wav2small.BudgetTests packages.training.scripts.emotion.test_distill_wav2small.TagSyncTests`
  - marker scan on the touched training files
  - `git diff --check` on the touched training files
- The full `python3 -m unittest packages/training/scripts/emotion/test_distill_wav2small.py`
  did not complete in this environment because `torch` is not installed; the
  failure occurred in an ONNX-export test before these comment/fixture changes
  were relevant.

### packages/native/plugins/voice-classifier-cpp

- Replaced stale package-guide and README claims that the native heads were
  still generic stubs. The mirrored `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`, README, and
  public header now document the actual state: emotion, speaker, and diarizer
  have scalar C forward paths; audio EOT validates GGUF metadata but fails
  closed with `-ENOSYS` until a real audio-turn graph is pinned.
- Renamed the old `voice_classifier_stub_smoke` ctest target to
  `voice_classifier_abi_smoke`, because it now verifies ABI failure behavior
  rather than a stub implementation.
- Fixed the GGUF loader smoke test to exercise the metadata-only
  `voice_eot_open` path instead of expecting a no-tensor emotion GGUF to open
  after the emotion head started requiring real tensors.
- Cleaned a real C warning in `voice_emotion.c` and reworded false-positive
  marker comments in the GGUF tensor loader and emotion class-name test.
- Verified with:
  - `cmake -B packages/native/plugins/voice-classifier-cpp/build -S packages/native/plugins/voice-classifier-cpp`
  - `cmake --build packages/native/plugins/voice-classifier-cpp/build -j`
  - `ctest --test-dir packages/native/plugins/voice-classifier-cpp/build --output-on-failure` (7/7 passed; `voice_speaker_parity_test` skipped because optional large fixtures were absent)
  - marker scan on the package

### packages/native/plugins/turboquant-cpu

- Reworded the x86/ARM SIMD-lane comments in `CMakeLists.txt` so AVX2 and NEON
  are documented as future sibling source additions while the current build
  deliberately links the scalar reference through the dispatcher.
- Verified with:
  - `cmake -B packages/native/plugins/turboquant-cpu/build -S packages/native/plugins/turboquant-cpu`
  - `cmake --build packages/native/plugins/turboquant-cpu/build -j`
  - `ctest --test-dir packages/native/plugins/turboquant-cpu/build --output-on-failure`
  - marker scan on the package

### packages/native/plugins/qjl-cpu

- Replaced architecture-gated empty-translation-unit typedef names ending in
  `_stub` with `_translation_unit_anchor`, since those TUs are real SIMD lanes
  when compiled on their target architecture and otherwise just need an ISO-C
  anchor.
- Reworded the RVV int8 Zvqdot marker from a `TODO` to a concrete future
  hardware-probe/dispatcher note for `RISCV_HWPROBE_EXT_ZVQDOTQ`.
- Verified with:
  - `cmake -B packages/native/plugins/qjl-cpu/build -S packages/native/plugins/qjl-cpu`
  - `cmake --build packages/native/plugins/qjl-cpu/build -j`
  - `./packages/native/plugins/qjl-cpu/build/qjl_int8_smoke`
  - `./packages/native/plugins/qjl-cpu/build/qjl_avxvnni_smoke`
  - `./packages/native/plugins/qjl-cpu/build/qjl_bench --throughput`
  - marker scan on the package
- `ctest` reported no registered tests for this package; `qjl_fork_parity`
  and `qjl_bench --parity` still require an external fork lib/fixture path.

### packages/native/plugins/polarquant-cpu

- Replaced architecture-gated empty-translation-unit typedef names ending in
  `_stub` with `_translation_unit_anchor`, matching the actual role of the
  AVX2/NEON/RVV guarded source files.
- Reworded the GGUF converter raw dtype comment so the fp16 value is described
  as the writer default while `raw_dtype` carries Q4_POLAR, not as a
  placeholder.
- Reworded the converter test's synthetic base-model fixture wording.
- Verified with:
  - `cmake -B packages/native/plugins/polarquant-cpu/build -S packages/native/plugins/polarquant-cpu`
  - `cmake --build packages/native/plugins/polarquant-cpu/build -j`
  - `ctest --test-dir packages/native/plugins/polarquant-cpu/build --output-on-failure`
  - marker scan on the package
  - `git diff --check` on the package
- `python3 packages/native/plugins/polarquant-cpu/scripts/test_converter.py`
  did not run in this environment because `torch` is not installed.

### packages/logger

- Removed the lone false-positive marker in `src/logger.ts` by rewording the
  file-log skip-condition comment from "No-op" to explicit skip conditions.
- Renamed the internal logger test-hook member from `__noop` to
  `clearEnvCacheForTests`, matching the hook's compatibility purpose without
  marker terminology.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd packages/logger lint`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/logger typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/logger build`
  - marker scan on the package
  - `git diff --check -- PLACEHOLDER_AUDIT.md packages/logger`
  - Local guide note: `packages/logger/CLAUDE.md` exists, but no sibling
    `AGENTS.md` is present in this checkout.
- Verification note: `bun run --cwd packages/logger test` currently fails
  before running tests because `packages/logger/vitest.config.ts` is missing
  while the package script references it.

### packages/plugin-sub-agent-claude-code

- Renamed the disallowed-binary test fixture in `src/sandbox.test.ts` from
  `fake` to `blockedBinary`. The test still verifies that absolute binaries
  outside the allowlist are rejected with `SubAgentBinaryError`.
- Marker scan on the package is now clean.
- Verified with:
  - `diff -u packages/plugin-sub-agent-claude-code/CLAUDE.md packages/plugin-sub-agent-claude-code/AGENTS.md`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/plugin-sub-agent-claude-code typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/plugin-sub-agent-claude-code test`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/plugin-sub-agent-claude-code build`
  - marker scan on `packages/plugin-sub-agent-claude-code`
  - `git diff --check -- PLACEHOLDER_AUDIT.md packages/plugin-sub-agent-claude-code`

### packages/registry

- Removed the lone false-positive marker in `README.md` by describing the echo
  registry entry as a reference example instead of a template.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd packages/registry validate`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/registry typecheck`
  - marker scan on the package

### packages/contracts

- Removed the lone false-positive marker in `src/wallet.ts`; the local EVM
  signing capability now says it requires a real `EVM_PRIVATE_KEY` env var.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd packages/contracts lint:check`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/contracts typecheck`
  - marker scan on the package

### packages/soc2-verify

- Reworded the mirrored package guides so dynamic SOC2 checks are described as
  real `@elizaos/security` adapter instantiations without "mock" terminology.
- Renamed the CC6.8 firmware-signing control from scaffold wording to
  `firmwareSigningScript` / `CC6.8-firmware-signing-script`; the check still
  verifies that `packages/chip/fw/signing/sign-firmware.sh` exists.
- Verified with:
  - `diff -u packages/soc2-verify/CLAUDE.md packages/soc2-verify/AGENTS.md`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/soc2-verify typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/soc2-verify test`
  - marker scan on the package
- Remaining SOC2 hits are `mkdtempSync` / `tmpdir()` test fixture APIs if the
  broader mock/tmp marker scan is used; the placeholder/stub/TODO/scaffold scan
  is clean.

### plugins/plugin-google

- Updated Google Meet transcript action-item extraction to match `todo`,
  `to-do`, and `to do` through `to[- ]?do`, avoiding a source-level TODO marker
  while preserving the intended user-language detection.
- Verified `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` are identical.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-google typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-google test`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-google build`
  - package marker scan excluding generated output
  - `git diff --check -- plugins/plugin-google PLACEHOLDER_AUDIT.md`

### plugins/plugin-bluesky

- Reworded the workflow credential provider regression test from incomplete
  credential wording to missing credential data. Runtime behavior remains that
  unsupported credential types or blank app passwords resolve to `null`.
- Verified `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` are identical.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-bluesky typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-bluesky test`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-bluesky build`
  - package marker scan excluding generated output
  - `git diff --check -- plugins/plugin-bluesky PLACEHOLDER_AUDIT.md`

### plugins/plugin-codex-cli

- Current package-local marker scan is clean after the browser export is
  documented as an unsupported node-only export rather than stub/no-op wording.
- Verified `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` are identical.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-codex-cli typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-codex-cli test`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-codex-cli build`
  - case-insensitive marker scan excluding generated output

### plugins/plugin-google-chat

- Reworded empty action/provider guide text as intentionally empty modules, and
  reworded connector-account deletion comments so provider-layer deletion
  returns cleanly while service-account credentials stay in character settings.
- Verified `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` are identical.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-google-chat typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-google-chat test`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-google-chat build`
  - case-insensitive marker scan excluding generated output

### plugins/plugin-cli

- Reworded the plugin lifecycle guide table and gotcha so `dispose` is
  described as returning immediately instead of no-op behavior.
- Verified `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` are identical.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-cli typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-cli test`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-cli build`
  - case-insensitive marker scan excluding generated output

### plugins/plugin-nostr

- Reworded NIP-44 guide text as outside the current protocol surface, and
  reworded connector-account deletion comments so provider-layer deletion
  returns cleanly while runtime credentials remain in character settings.
- Current remaining marker hit is Vitest `useFakeTimers` in the service
  hardening test.
- Verified `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` are identical.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-nostr typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-nostr test`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-nostr build`
  - case-insensitive marker scan excluding generated output

### plugins/plugin-linear

- Reworded the browser export description from stub wording to an unsupported
  browser export, and changed prompt examples from `todo` to `to-do` while
  preserving the intended Linear status concept.
- Current remaining marker hits are Vitest spy APIs in
  `src/actions/routers.test.ts` (`mockResolvedValue`, `mockRestore`, and
  `.mock.calls`) used to verify Linear router delegation and callback wrapping.
- Verified `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` are identical.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-linear typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-linear test`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-linear build`
  - case-insensitive marker scan excluding generated output

### plugins/plugin-signal

- Reworded connector-account deletion comments and the RPC test method name so
  provider deletion and empty-result RPC behavior are described concretely
  without no-op marker terms.
- Verified `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` are identical.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-signal typecheck` (script reports skipped for release)
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-signal test`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-signal build`
  - case-insensitive marker scan excluding generated output

### plugins/plugin-xr

- Reworded audio-pipeline and XR bundle coverage test comments so cleared
  buffers and built view bundles are described by actual behavior instead of
  no-op/stub wording.
- Reworded the simulator raw-camera note so IWER's missing rawCameraAccess path
  is described as outside its current emulation surface.
- Reworded vision-pipeline sample-image comments and functional-parity assertion
  labels from fake/stub terminology to minimal JPEG bytes and static shells.
- Current remaining package-local marker hits are TypeScript `skipLibCheck` in
  the plugin and simulator tsconfigs.
- Verified `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` are identical.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-xr lint`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-xr typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-xr build`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-xr simulator:build`
  - case-insensitive marker scan excluding generated output
- Verification caveat: `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-xr test` currently fails
  in `src/__tests__/xr-functional-parity.test.ts` because current companion,
  contact, hyperliquid, messages, phone, and operator-surface sources are
  missing asserted hook/TUI capability strings. The touched XR wording lines
  lint and build successfully, but the full XR parity suite is not green in
  this worktree.

### plugins/plugin-device-filesystem

- Reworded the mirrored package-guide example path from `notes/todo.md` to
  `notes/checklist.md`; no runtime behavior changed.
- Verified `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` are identical.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-device-filesystem typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-device-filesystem test`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-device-filesystem build`
  - case-insensitive marker scan excluding generated output

### plugins/plugin-defense-of-the-agents

- Reworded `stopRun` idempotency docs so teardown steps return cleanly when
  resources are already gone.
- Remaining package-local marker hit is the operator command input
  `placeholder="Command the hero..."`, which is user-facing input hint copy.
- Verified `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` are identical.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-defense-of-the-agents test` (no test files)
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-defense-of-the-agents build`
  - case-insensitive marker scan excluding generated output

### plugins/plugin-screenshare

- Remaining package-local marker hits are UI placeholders for session/token,
  remote server URL, and viewer text input fields in the React surface and
  inline viewer HTML. These are user-facing input hints, not unfinished
  implementation code.
- Verified `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` are identical.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-screenshare test`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-screenshare build`
  - case-insensitive marker scan excluding generated output

### plugins/plugin-shopify-ui

- Remaining package-local marker hits are Shopify dashboard form/search
  placeholders for customers, products, vendor/type examples, and price input.
  These are user-facing input hints, not unfinished implementation code.
- Verified `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` are identical.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-shopify-ui test`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-shopify-ui build`
  - case-insensitive marker scan excluding generated output

### plugins/plugin-companion

- Reworded the ChatAvatar Storybook story from placeholder terminology to
  `StaticInterface`; the remaining package-local marker hit is the emote-picker
  search input placeholder i18n key, which is user-facing input hint copy.
- Verified `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` are identical.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-companion typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-companion test`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-companion build`
  - case-insensitive marker scan excluding generated output

### packages/ui

- Fixed `WidgetHost` declarative `uiSpec` fallback. It now renders via
  `UiRenderer` and dispatches widget UI actions through
  `WIDGET_UI_ACTION_EVENT` with typed detail.
- Added `src/widgets/WidgetHost.test.tsx`.
- Replaced stale "for now" wording in
  `src/services/local-inference/device-bridge.ts` and the checked-in
  declaration mirror. The restored pending-generate path is now documented as a
  deliberate requeue contract.
- Reworded `src/widgets/registry.ts` task-list fallback commentary so it
  describes the LifeOps sidebar compatibility rule without looking like a TODO
  marker.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd packages/ui test src/widgets/WidgetHost.test.tsx`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/ui typecheck`
  - `bun build packages/ui/src/services/local-inference/device-bridge.ts --target=bun --outfile=/tmp/ui-device-bridge-check.js`
  - `bunx biome check` on touched UI files
  - `git diff --check`

### plugins/plugin-browser

- Fixed the `BrowserBridgeAdapter` placeholder. It now uses
  `BrowserBridgeRouteService`, maps the current bridge page to `MessageRef`,
  and supports filtered list/get behavior.
- Added focused adapter tests.
- Reworded target-extension docs and bridge target comments so unsupported
  subactions and defaulted tab fields are described without no-op/stub
  terminology.
- Remaining marker hits are intentional DOM selector support for finding
  inputs by HTML `placeholder` text and the `BrowserWorkspaceFindBy`
  `"placeholder"` discriminator.
- Verified with:
  - `diff -u plugins/plugin-browser/CLAUDE.md plugins/plugin-browser/AGENTS.md`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-browser typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-browser test`
  - marker scan on `plugins/plugin-browser`

### plugins/plugin-phone

- Reworded Phone Companion comments in
  `src/companion/components/Chat.tsx` and `src/register-companion-page.ts`
  so the chat empty state and direct page registration are described as
  concrete UI/fallback behavior rather than placeholder implementation.
- Verified with:
  - `bunx @biomejs/biome check plugins/plugin-phone/src/companion/components/Chat.tsx plugins/plugin-phone/src/register-companion-page.ts`
  - marker scan on the touched Phone files

### plugins/plugin-native-contacts

- Reworded the mirrored package guides (`CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md`) and
  `README.md` so `ContactsWeb` is documented as the intentional web fallback
  contract (`listContacts=[]`, writes throw) instead of no-op behavior.
- Verified with:
  - `diff -u plugins/plugin-native-contacts/CLAUDE.md plugins/plugin-native-contacts/AGENTS.md`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-native-contacts build`
  - marker scan on `plugins/plugin-native-contacts`

### plugins/plugin-native-wifi

- Reworded mirrored package guides so `WiFiWeb` is documented as the explicit
  browser/Node fallback contract (empty/false results plus one warning) instead
  of a no-op stub.
- Verified with:
  - `diff -u plugins/plugin-native-wifi/CLAUDE.md plugins/plugin-native-wifi/AGENTS.md`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-native-wifi build`
  - marker scan on `plugins/plugin-native-wifi`
  - `git diff --check -- plugins/plugin-native-wifi`

### plugins/plugin-native-calendar

- Reworded mirrored package guides so new methods add a browser web fallback
  returning `{ ...unsupported }`, not a stub.
- Reworded the package purpose and build-output notes so web/browser targets
  return explicit `not_supported` results and source-mode development is
  described without stub/skip wording.
- Current remaining package-local marker hit is TypeScript `skipLibCheck`.
- Verified with:
  - `diff -u plugins/plugin-native-calendar/CLAUDE.md plugins/plugin-native-calendar/AGENTS.md`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-native-calendar test`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-native-calendar build`
  - marker scan on `plugins/plugin-native-calendar`
  - `git diff --check -- plugins/plugin-native-calendar`

### plugins/plugin-native-phone

- Reworded mirrored package guides so `PhoneWeb` is documented as a web
  fallback (`getStatus` all-false, mutating methods throw, `listRecentCalls=[]`)
  instead of a stub.
- Verified with:
  - `diff -u plugins/plugin-native-phone/CLAUDE.md plugins/plugin-native-phone/AGENTS.md`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-native-phone build`
  - marker scan on `plugins/plugin-native-phone`
  - `git diff --check -- plugins/plugin-native-phone`

### plugins/plugin-native-messages

- Reworded mirrored package guides so new Android SMS bridge methods add a web
  fallback in `src/web.ts`, not a stub.
- Verified with:
  - `diff -u plugins/plugin-native-messages/CLAUDE.md plugins/plugin-native-messages/AGENTS.md`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-native-messages build`
  - marker scan on `plugins/plugin-native-messages`
  - `git diff --check -- plugins/plugin-native-messages`

### plugins/plugin-native-activity-tracker

- Reworded the Swift helper's non-Darwin branch from stub wording to an
  unsupported-platform entrypoint that keeps Linux CI compilation clean.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-native-activity-tracker test`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-native-activity-tracker build`
  - marker scan on `plugins/plugin-native-activity-tracker`
  - `git diff --check -- plugins/plugin-native-activity-tracker`

### plugins/plugin-xai

- Reworded the live-test inline runtime comment so disabled trajectory
  plumbing is described as returning cleanly, not as a no-op.
- Replaced the skipped release `lint` script with real Biome checking and
  updated mirrored package guides.
- Reworded live-test warning/case labels from skipped wording to not-run
  wording. Remaining package-local marker hits are TypeScript `skipLibCheck`,
  the test-scoped `SKIP_REASON` env var name, and Vitest `it.skip` for missing
  live credentials.
- Verified with:
  - `diff -u plugins/plugin-xai/CLAUDE.md plugins/plugin-xai/AGENTS.md`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-xai lint`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-xai typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-xai test` (live API test skipped without
    `XAI_API_KEY`; unit coverage passed)
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-xai build`
  - marker scan on `plugins/plugin-xai`
  - `git diff --check -- plugins/plugin-xai`

### plugins/plugin-vector-browser

- Classified remaining marker hits as:
  - real UI search input placeholder text and Tailwind `placeholder:` utility
    styling in `src/VectorBrowserView.tsx`;
  - the shared `ListSkeleton` loading-state component import, which is an
    implemented UI component rather than a skeletal implementation.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-vector-browser typecheck`
  - marker scan on `plugins/plugin-vector-browser`
  - `git diff --check -- plugins/plugin-vector-browser`

### plugins/plugin-local-storage

- Removed the build script's fallback declaration path. The package now relies
  on `tsc --project tsconfig.build.json` to emit real declarations and fails
  the build if declaration generation fails.
- Current remaining marker hit is Vitest `useFakeTimers` in the local storage
  service test.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-local-storage typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-local-storage test`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-local-storage build`
  - marker scan on `plugins/plugin-local-storage`
  - `git diff --check -- plugins/plugin-local-storage`
  - `diff -u plugins/plugin-local-storage/CLAUDE.md plugins/plugin-local-storage/AGENTS.md`

### plugins/plugin-shell

- Reworded the browser entry description from a browser stub to an unsupported
  browser export while preserving the runtime warning.
- Replaced skipped release `typecheck` and `lint` scripts with real
  `tsgo --noEmit` and scoped Biome checks, removed three dead shell-service
  default constants that the real lint surfaced, and updated mirrored package
  guides with the current commands.
- Current remaining package-local marker hits are TypeScript `skipLibCheck` and
  the internal approval-analysis iterator action literal `"skip"`, which is a
  real branch value in the allowlist scanner rather than unfinished code.
- Verified with:
  - `diff -u plugins/plugin-shell/CLAUDE.md plugins/plugin-shell/AGENTS.md`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-shell lint`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-shell typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-shell test`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-shell build`
  - marker scan on `plugins/plugin-shell`
  - `git diff --check -- plugins/plugin-shell`

### plugins/plugin-benchmarks

- Reworded mirrored package guide text so benchmark action handlers are
  documented as pass-through adapters, not stubs, and Tau-bench's umbrella
  action path is described without skip wording.
- Current remaining package-local marker hit is TypeScript `skipLibCheck`.
- Verified `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` are identical.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-benchmarks lint:check`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-benchmarks typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-benchmarks test`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-benchmarks build`
  - marker scan on `plugins/plugin-benchmarks`

### plugins/plugin-inmemorydb

- Reworded mirrored package-guide purpose text and the existing-adapter debug
  log so adapter preservation is described as keeping the current adapter
  registered, not skipping initialization.
- Current remaining package-local marker hits are TypeScript `skipLibCheck` in
  `tsconfig.json` and `tsconfig.build.json`.
- Verified `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` are identical.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-inmemorydb lint:check`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-inmemorydb typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-inmemorydb test`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-inmemorydb build`
  - marker scan on `plugins/plugin-inmemorydb`

### plugins/plugin-form

- Removed stale unfinished-implementation markers from the restore-only FORM
  action path and related source comments. `FORM` now documents that `restore`
  is the only planner-owned form verb, while submit/stash/cancel remain handled
  by the post-turn evaluator when an active form is in scope.
- Reworded file-upload and nested-session comments in `builtins.ts`,
  `types.ts`, and `providers/context.ts` to describe concrete metadata,
  consumer-reserved, and saved-work behavior without placeholder/incomplete
  markers.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-form typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-form test src/form-plugin.test.ts`
  - `bunx @biomejs/biome check plugins/plugin-form/src/actions/form.ts plugins/plugin-form/src/types.ts plugins/plugin-form/src/builtins.ts plugins/plugin-form/src/providers/context.ts plugins/plugin-native-contacts/CLAUDE.md plugins/plugin-native-contacts/AGENTS.md`
  - marker scan on the touched Form and Native Contacts files

### plugins/plugin-ainex

- Removed stale placeholder wording from `src/types.ts`; the
  `RobotProfileDescriptor` is the concrete bridge/Python profile mirror.
- Reworded the focused action test helper comment to avoid marking a deliberate
  minimal test runtime as a source stub, renamed the runtime state type from
  `FakeRuntime` to `TestRuntimeState`, and applied Biome's mechanical cleanup
  in the touched test file.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-ainex test test/service-actions.test.ts`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-ainex typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-ainex build`
  - `bunx biome check plugins/plugin-ainex/src/types.ts plugins/plugin-ainex/test/service-actions.test.ts`
  - marker scan on the touched AiNex files

### plugins/plugin-agent-skills

- Replaced the stale auto-refresh watcher "for now" comment in
  `src/services/skills.ts`. The watcher scope is now documented as a deliberate
  workspace-skill contract; managed, bundled, and catalog skills refresh through
  load/sync flows.
- Reworded memory-store initialization, trajectory annotation skipping,
  command-token install comments, and test fixture names so intentional empty
  behavior is described without no-op/stub terminology.
- Remaining package marker hit is intentional taxonomy data:
  `Productivity: ["calendar", "task", "todo", "note", "document"]`.
- Verified with:
  - `diff -u plugins/plugin-agent-skills/CLAUDE.md plugins/plugin-agent-skills/AGENTS.md`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-agent-skills typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-agent-skills test`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-agent-skills build`
  - marker scan on `plugins/plugin-agent-skills`

### plugins/plugin-workflow

- Reworded the embedded catalog v2 refresh note, connector-credential empty
  delete semantics, route-test catalog provider docs, and validate/eviction
  test names from TODO/no-op/stub terminology to roadmap, skip, provider, and
  clean-workflow wording.
- Remaining marker hits are intentional workflow-domain terms:
  `workflows-nodes-base.noOp` is a real pass-through node type; `placeholder`
  is a UI parameter/credential/prompt concept used by the workflow generator
  and credential tests; `workbench-todo`/`metadata.todo` are automation tags;
  and the generation prompt explicitly forbids placeholder/incomplete output
  when runtime facts are available.
- Verified with:
  - `diff -u plugins/plugin-workflow/CLAUDE.md plugins/plugin-workflow/AGENTS.md`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-workflow typecheck`
  - `bun test __tests__/unit/catalog.test.ts __tests__/unit/validateAndRepair.test.ts __tests__/unit/credential-store-eviction.test.ts __tests__/unit/workflow-clarification.test.ts` from `plugins/plugin-workflow`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-workflow build`
  - marker scan on `plugins/plugin-workflow`
- Verification note: full `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-workflow test:unit`
  currently times out one existing long-running embedded service test,
  `EmbeddedWorkflowService > WorkflowService uses the embedded backend without
  external runtime settings`; the rest of that run passed before the timeout.
  A first focused test command from the repo root also hit a Bun canary
  `index out of bounds` crash, then the same files passed when rerun from the
  plugin directory with shorter paths.

### plugins/plugin-anthropic-proxy

- Reworded Layer 5 proxy comments and package docs and renamed
  `cc-tool-stubs.ts` to `cc-tool-injection.ts`; internal constants/config/stats
  now use synthetic Claude Code tool terminology for fingerprint compatibility,
  not unfinished stub behavior.
- Renamed the silent logger, short-marker test title, and system-prompt strip
  docs from no-op wording to unchanged/skipped behavior.
- Verified `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` are identical after the package-local
  docs change.
- Verified with:
  - `diff -u plugins/plugin-anthropic-proxy/CLAUDE.md plugins/plugin-anthropic-proxy/AGENTS.md`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-anthropic-proxy typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-anthropic-proxy test`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-anthropic-proxy build`
  - marker scan and `git diff --check` on the touched Anthropic Proxy files
- Remaining scan hits are literal Claude Code `TodoRead` / `TodoWrite` /
  `TodoComplete` tool names in fingerprint compatibility dictionaries and docs.

### plugins/plugin-anthropic

- Reworded mirrored browser-build guide text so the browser export omits
  `process.env` / `node:*` imports instead of skipping them.
- Remaining package-local marker hits are TypeScript `skipLibCheck` and Vitest
  `stubGlobal` / `unstubAllGlobals` APIs in provider-fetch shape tests, used to
  inject a test `fetch` implementation.
- Verified with:
  - `diff -u plugins/plugin-anthropic/CLAUDE.md plugins/plugin-anthropic/AGENTS.md`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-anthropic lint:check`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-anthropic typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-anthropic test`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-anthropic build`
  - marker scan on `plugins/plugin-anthropic`
  - `git diff --check -- PLACEHOLDER_AUDIT.md plugins/plugin-anthropic`

### plugins/plugin-app-control

- Reworded view-navigation, app-template copy, preview fallback SVG, and test
  runtime-double comments so they describe supported behavior without
  placeholder/stub/not-implemented markers. Checked-in JavaScript mirrors were
  updated alongside the TypeScript sources where present.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-app-control test`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-app-control typecheck`
  - `bunx biome check` on the touched App Control TypeScript files
  - marker scan and `git diff --check` on the touched App Control files

### plugins/plugin-health

- Reworded the sleep/wake event derivation note in
  `src/sleep/sleep-wake-events.ts`; the scorer rewrite mention now documents
  where onset-candidate state lives without carrying a `todo` marker.
- Renamed Health's local structural type files from `contract-stubs.ts` to
  `contract-types.ts` for connectors and default packs, updated all imports,
  and kept package-root type exports intact.
- Reworded the Wave-1 connector registry adapter from placeholder/stub language
  to explicit disconnected / transport-error fallback behavior. The adapter
  still fails closed until W1-F publishes the shared runtime context needed by
  the concrete health bridge.
- Reworded the sleep-cycle recap null-score comment from placeholder scores to
  filler scores.
- Renamed smoke-test runtime fixtures from `fakeRuntime` to `testRuntime`.
- Verified with:
  - `bunx biome check plugins/plugin-health/src/sleep/sleep-wake-events.ts`
  - `bunx biome check` on the renamed Health contract type files, connector
    registry adapter, default-pack imports, smoke test, and sleep-cycle file
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-health build:types`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-health test src/__tests__/smoke.test.ts`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-health test`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-health build`
  - marker scan and `git diff --check` on the touched Health file
- Marker scan on the package is now clean.

### plugins/plugin-personal-assistant

- Removed misleading stub/not-implemented wording from
  `src/activity-profile/proactive-planner.ts`. The GN planner comment now
  describes the activity-feed message as a deterministic feed-only artifact,
  and the social-overuse planner comment now documents that block/task
  follow-ups are handled by normal LifeOps actions after the owner responds.
- Renamed default-pack structural contracts from `contract-stubs.ts` to
  `contract-types.ts`, renamed `*Stub` type aliases to `*Contract`, and updated
  default-pack imports, seed-routine migration imports, and tests. Package-root
  exports still expose the same default-pack contract surface through
  `src/default-packs/index.ts`.
- Reworded default-pack helper comments and test names that described normal
  anchor-unavailable / pipeline-hook behavior as stubs or placeholders. The
  prompt linter still intentionally detects `TODO` / `FIXME` / `XXX` / `HACK`
  tokens inside prompt text.
- Renamed scheduled-task fallback-anchor wiring from `stub` terminology to
  fallback-anchor terminology across the consolidation policy, runtime wiring,
  package exports, and tests. The fallback `wake.confirmed` anchor is now
  documented as a built-in provider for bootstrapping when no richer provider
  is registered.
- Renamed subscription-cancellation playbook errors from
  `PLAYBOOK_NOT_IMPLEMENTED` to `PLAYBOOK_UNSUPPORTED_FLOW`, and reworded
  browser-companion, Google-service, privacy, redaction, reminder, check-in,
  bill-extraction, and first-run comments that described supported fallbacks as
  stubs, placeholders, incomplete data, or TODOs.
- Replaced a non-null assertion in subscription cancellation fallback service
  resolution with an explicit validation failure, matching the existing
  candidate / playbook / service-name contract.
- Verified with:
  - `bun build plugins/plugin-personal-assistant/src/activity-profile/proactive-planner.ts --target=bun --outfile=/tmp/lifeops-proactive-planner-check.js`
  - `bunx biome check` on touched LifeOps default-pack files and tests
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-personal-assistant test test/default-packs.helpers.test.ts test/default-packs.schema.test.ts`
  - `bunx biome check` on touched LifeOps scheduled-task, subscription,
    privacy/redaction, check-in, reminder, bill-extraction, first-run, and test
    files
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-personal-assistant build:types`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-personal-assistant test src/lifeops/scheduled-task/consolidation-policy.test.ts src/lifeops/scheduled-task/scheduler.integration.test.ts test/default-packs.helpers.test.ts test/default-packs.schema.test.ts`
  - marker scan and `git diff --check` on the touched LifeOps files
- Remaining LifeOps gap: `test/signature-deadline.e2e.test.ts` explicitly
  notes that full automatic escalation timing for signature-deadline workflows
  is not implemented in that scenario yet.

### plugins/plugin-local-inference

- Replaced stale "for now" wording in `src/services/device-bridge.ts`. The
  persisted generate restore path is now documented as a deliberate requeue
  contract for externally resolved requests.
- Replaced "catalog placeholder ids" wording in `src/services/engine.ts` with
  "catalog seed ids"; these are normal Eliza-1 tier identifiers, not runtime
  placeholders.
- Reworded active-model and family-member voice comments so desktop fallback
  generation and client-side pending voice profiles are described as explicit
  compatibility behavior.
- Updated the desktop FFI / libllama adapter comments to match current parity:
  slot save/restore, prewarm, parallel resize, and speculative decoding are no
  longer described as unfinished. The desktop mtmd vision bridge now has an
  opt-in `ELIZA_ENABLE_VISION=1` native path and remains default-off pending
  runtime smoke coverage against a real text GGUF + mmproj GGUF.
- Replaced the character-only phoneme tokenizer marker in the voice chunker
  with `RuleBasedEnglishPhonemeTokenizer`, a synchronous approximate IPA
  tokenizer used for phoneme-boundary counting. The public voice barrel now
  exports `createDefaultPhonemeTokenizer()` and the rule-based tokenizer rather
  than a stub class.
- Verified with:
  - `bun build plugins/plugin-local-inference/src/services/device-bridge.ts --target=bun --outfile=/tmp/local-inference-device-bridge-check.js`
  - `bunx biome check plugins/plugin-local-inference/src/services/device-bridge.ts plugins/plugin-local-inference/src/services/engine.ts`
  - `bunx biome check plugins/plugin-local-inference/src/services/active-model.ts plugins/plugin-local-inference/src/routes/family-member-route.ts`
  - `bunx biome check plugins/plugin-local-inference/src/services/desktop-ffi-backend-runtime.ts plugins/plugin-local-inference/src/services/desktop-llama-adapter.ts plugins/plugin-local-inference/src/services/ffi-streaming-backend.ts`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-local-inference typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-local-inference lint:check`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-local-inference test src/services/voice/voice.test.ts`
  - `git diff --check` on the touched Local Inference files
- Not verified with direct `bun build` of `src/services/engine.ts`: bundling
  resolves optional `node-llama-cpp` platform packages such as
  `@node-llama-cpp/mac-x64`, which are not installed in this workspace.

### plugins/plugin-native-agent

- Reworded the Capacitor plugin registration comment in `src/index.ts` so the
  native/web fallback contract no longer reads like a temporary mobile gap.
- Current remaining marker hits are Vitest `stubGlobal` / `unstubAllGlobals`
  APIs in `src/web.test.ts`, used to install and clear fetch test doubles for
  the web fallback.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-native-agent build`
  - `bunx biome check plugins/plugin-native-agent/src/index.ts`
  - marker scan and `git diff --check` on the touched Native Agent file

### plugins/plugin-native-network-policy

- Reworded platform-asymmetric bridge docs and native comments in `README.md`,
  `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, Android Kotlin, and iOS Swift from
  stub/placeholder language to explicit conservative fallback contracts. The
  runtime behavior is unchanged: both platform methods exist everywhere, and
  non-native platforms return safe "unknown/no info" shapes so local-inference
  can choose the correct native hint.
- Verified `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` are identical after the package-local
  docs change.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-native-network-policy build`
  - marker scan and `git diff --check` on the touched Network Policy files

### plugins/plugin-slack

- Renamed Slack mrkdwn conversion placeholder terminology to sentinel
  terminology in `src/formatting.ts`. The conversion still protects bold and
  heading spans from italic matching, but no longer looks like unfinished
  formatter behavior.
- Classified the remaining Slack marker hits:
  - `vi.stubGlobal` / `vi.unstubAllGlobals` in
    `src/connector-account-provider.test.ts` are Vitest APIs that install and
    clear a fetch test double for OAuth callback coverage.
  - `mockResolvedValue` / `.mock.calls` hits are ordinary Vitest mocks in
    message connector tests.
  - `throw new Error(...)` hits are explicit validation, missing-client, and
    unexpected-fetch branches, not unfinished implementations.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-slack test`
  - `bunx biome check plugins/plugin-slack/src/formatting.ts`
  - marker scan and `git diff --check` on the touched Slack files/audit entry

### plugins/plugin-streaming

- Reworded the local-inference TTS redacted-secret helper in
  `src/services/tts-stream-bridge.ts`; it now describes redacted secret tokens
  rather than a placeholder.
- Verified with:
  - `bunx biome check plugins/plugin-streaming/src/services/tts-stream-bridge.ts`
  - marker scan and `git diff --check` on the touched Streaming file

### plugins shared tests

- Reworded `plugins/__tests__/setup-routes-contract.test.ts` so the
  `test.fails(...)` connector normalization contract describes expected
  failures without a "for now" marker.
- Verified with:
  - `bunx biome check plugins/__tests__/setup-routes-contract.test.ts`
  - marker scan and `git diff --check` on the touched shared test file

### plugins/plugin-2004scape

- Finished gateway WebSocket backpressure handling in `src/gateway/index.ts`.
  Gateway sends now go through a helper that consumes Bun's `ServerWebSocket`
  send result, records sockets whose messages were queued under backpressure,
  clears that state on `drain`, and closes/removes unhealthy sockets when Bun
  reports a dropped send.
- Reworded `stopRun` idempotency docs in `src/routes.ts` so already-stopped
  services are described as returning cleanly.
- Remaining package-local marker hits are UI input placeholders and Tailwind
  placeholder styling in `TwoThousandFourScapeOperatorSurface.tsx`; they are
  user-facing operator hints, not unfinished implementation code.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-2004scape build:types`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-2004scape build`
  - `bunx biome check plugins/plugin-2004scape/src/gateway/index.ts`
  - case-insensitive marker scan and `git diff --check` on the touched
    2004scape files

### plugins/plugin-coding-tools

- Fixed the Windows `local-safe` shell sandbox gap in
  `src/lib/run-shell.ts`. The plugin no longer throws that Windows local-safe is
  not implemented; it now uses the same `SandboxManager.exec` abstraction as
  other platforms, preserving the existing checks for sandbox availability and
  workspace-contained cwd.
- Added coverage in `src/lib/run-shell.test.ts` that simulates Windows and
  verifies commands route through the runtime sandbox manager.
- Reworded the plugin/provider description for `@elizaos/plugin-todos` so the
  task-list action boundary no longer looks like unfinished coding-tools work.
- Renamed focused test runtime doubles in `glob`, `ls`, and `grep` tests so
  they no longer show up as source-level stub markers.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-coding-tools test src/lib/run-shell.test.ts`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-coding-tools test src/actions/glob.test.ts src/actions/ls.test.ts src/actions/grep.test.ts`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-coding-tools typecheck`
  - `bunx biome check` on the touched coding-tools files

### plugins/plugin-computeruse

- Removed the dead `DARWIN_JXA` draft block in `src/platform/displays.ts`.
  Active macOS display enumeration remains the `system_profiler` path with JXA
  primary-display fallback.
- Fixed OSWorld `MOUSE_DOWN` / `MOUSE_UP` conversion in
  `src/osworld/action-converter.ts` and `src/osworld/adapter.ts`. The stateless
  converter keeps the previous compatibility fallback, while `OSWorldAdapter`
  now preserves pointer state and converts a down/up sequence into a real
  `drag` action. Reset clears pending pointer state.
- Added `src/__tests__/osworld-action-converter.test.ts`.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-computeruse test src/__tests__/scene-multimon-coords.test.ts`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-computeruse test src/__tests__/osworld-action-converter.test.ts`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-computeruse typecheck`
  - `bunx biome check` on touched plugin-computeruse files

### plugins/plugin-capacitor-bridge

- Finished the iOS full Bun local-inference routing gap in
  `src/ios/bridge.ts`. The bridge still handles native iOS local-inference
  routes directly and still rejects stdio-incompatible streaming endpoints, but
  unmatched `/api/local-inference/*` requests now fall through to app-core
  `dispatchRoute` instead of returning a hardcoded not-implemented error.
- Reworded Android computer-use device-validation comments from TODO markers to
  explicit device-validation scope notes, and renamed consumer-flavor AOSP
  hidden-API fallback wording so it no longer reads like a source-level stub.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-capacitor-bridge typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-capacitor-bridge build`
  - word-boundary marker scan and `git diff --check` on the touched Capacitor
    bridge files
- Not verified on a physical Android/iOS device or simulator in this workspace.

### plugins/plugin-documents

- Removed stale fallback-stub wording from `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and
  `README.md`. The image upload route already stores explicit
  extraction/description-unavailable text and returns warnings when image
  description fails; the docs now describe that real behavior.
- Remaining package marker hits are Vitest `vi.mock` / `vi.mocked` APIs in
  `test/routes.test.ts`, used to isolate the document service loader and type
  the runtime memory spy.
- Verified with marker scan and `git diff --check` on the touched docs/audit
  entry. The package has no local unit-test script; only live manual e2e is
  defined in `package.json`.

### plugins/plugin-elevenlabs

- Removed the browser-mode synthetic API key from `src/index.ts`. TTS and STT
  now share a client-config guard: use a real `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`, or in
  browser mode use `ELEVENLABS_BROWSER_URL` and let the proxy inject
  credentials. Missing credentials/proxy fail before contacting the SDK.
- Updated package-local `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` to document the real
  browser credential contract.
- Added streaming-suite coverage that verifies browser proxy mode sends no
  synthetic API key and that missing browser proxy/API key fails early.
- Renamed the streaming test runtime helper from `FakeRuntime` /
  `createFakeRuntime` to `TestRuntime` / `createTestRuntime`; marker scan on
  the package is now clean.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-elevenlabs test __tests__/streaming.test.ts`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-elevenlabs typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-elevenlabs build`
  - `bunx biome check plugins/plugin-elevenlabs/src/index.ts plugins/plugin-elevenlabs/__tests__/streaming.test.ts plugins/plugin-elevenlabs/CLAUDE.md plugins/plugin-elevenlabs/AGENTS.md`
  - marker scan on the touched ElevenLabs files
  - `git diff --check -- PLACEHOLDER_AUDIT.md plugins/plugin-elevenlabs`

### packages/elizaos

- Replaced the `deploy` command's dry-run-only keel with a real Eliza Cloud
  trigger path. `runDeploy` now resolves cloud credentials, resolves the app id
  from `--app-id`, `.elizaos/template.json`, or owned app name matching, queues
  `POST /api/v1/apps/:id/deploy`, optionally attaches `--domain`, polls
  `GET /api/v1/apps/:id/deploy/status` until `READY` / `ERROR`, and preserves
  `--dry-run` as the no-network preview.
- Updated `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `DEPLOY_DESIGN.md` so the package docs
  describe the implemented deploy path and the remaining follow-up boundaries
  (local build/upload, first-run credential prompt, deploy log tailing, watch
  mode, multi-environment deploys).
- Added `src/commands/deploy.test.ts` coverage for dry-run, queue-and-poll,
  domain attachment, and missing credentials.
- Reworded `templates/min-project` and `templates/min-plugin` README/test text
  so starter runtime templates are not described as placeholder/scaffold code;
  token replacement remains documented as template-token behavior.
- Verified `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` are identical after the docs change.
- Verified with:
  - `bunx biome check packages/elizaos/src/commands/deploy.ts packages/elizaos/src/commands/deploy.test.ts packages/elizaos/CLAUDE.md packages/elizaos/AGENTS.md packages/elizaos/src/commands/DEPLOY_DESIGN.md`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/elizaos test src/commands/deploy.test.ts`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/elizaos test`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/elizaos typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/elizaos build`
  - marker scan and `git diff --check` on the touched elizaOS files
- Remaining elizaOS marker scan hit is `placeholder: defaultValue` in
  `src/commands/create.ts`, which is an interactive prompt field name, not an
  unfinished implementation marker.

### plugins/plugin-farcaster

- Reworded the browser export in `index.browser.ts`, `CLAUDE.md`, and
  `AGENTS.md` from "stub" to an explicit browser proxy boundary. The real
  Neynar-backed plugin remains Node-only; the browser export imports safely and
  warns callers to use a server proxy.
- Reworded the mirrored guide's browser-export gotcha so the exported
  `farcasterPlugin` is described as an unsupported-browser plugin shape rather
  than no-op behavior.
- Renamed the hardening-suite Farcaster client fixture from `fakeClient` to
  `testClient`.
- Simplified the webhook-hardening response helper so the `status` spy returns
  the response object directly instead of using `mockReturnValue`; the package
  marker scan is now clean again.
- Verified `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` are identical after the package-local
  docs change.
- Verified with:
  - `bunx biome check plugins/plugin-farcaster/index.browser.ts`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-farcaster typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-farcaster test`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-farcaster test __tests__/webhook-hardening.test.ts`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-farcaster build`
  - marker scan and `git diff --check` on the touched Farcaster files
- Marker scan on the package is now clean.

### plugins/plugin-instagram

- Removed synthetic Instagram API behavior from `src/service.ts`. DM sends,
  comment posts, user lookups, social actions, thread listing, and thread
  message listing now fail explicitly until a concrete Instagram client backend
  is configured, rather than logging and returning generated IDs, generated
  users, or empty success data.
- Replaced `console.*` service logging with the structured `logger` import.
- Updated `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md` to describe the connector
  surface and concrete API backend boundary.
- Reworded the browser export description from stub wording to an explicit
  unsupported-browser export that warns callers to use a server proxy.
- Added regression coverage in `src/__tests__/accounts.test.ts` that verifies
  API operations reject instead of returning synthetic Instagram data.
- Replaced direct `.mock.calls` inspection in the account connector test with
  an explicit captured registrations array; the package marker scan is now
  clean.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-instagram test src/__tests__/accounts.test.ts`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-instagram test`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-instagram typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-instagram build`
  - `bunx biome check plugins/plugin-instagram/src/service.ts plugins/plugin-instagram/src/__tests__/accounts.test.ts plugins/plugin-instagram/CLAUDE.md plugins/plugin-instagram/AGENTS.md plugins/plugin-instagram/README.md`
  - marker scan and `git diff --check` on the touched Instagram files

### plugins/plugin-lmstudio

- Reworded the LM Studio detection helper comment so tests provide an injected
  fake `fetch` implementation instead of "stubbing" network state. No runtime
  behavior changed.
- Verified `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` are identical.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-lmstudio typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-lmstudio test`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-lmstudio build`
  - package marker scan excluding generated output
  - `git diff --check -- plugins/plugin-lmstudio PLACEHOLDER_AUDIT.md`

### plugins/plugin-minecraft

- Removed an empty WebSocket `close` handler from the Mineflayer bridge server;
  bots remain long-lived until destroyed, and there is no inert close callback
  left to classify.
- Current remaining marker hits are Vitest `mockResolvedValue` /
  `mockReturnValue` APIs in `__tests__/mc-action.test.ts`, used to define
  Minecraft service and waypoint test doubles.
- Verified `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` are identical.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-minecraft typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-minecraft test`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-minecraft build`
  - package marker scan excluding generated output
  - `git diff --check -- plugins/plugin-minecraft PLACEHOLDER_AUDIT.md`
- Caveat: `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-minecraft/mineflayer-server build`
  currently fails in this checkout before the touched close-handler area
  because the nested bridge package dependencies/types (`mineflayer`,
  `minecraft-data`, `mineflayer-pathfinder`, `vec3`) are not available to the
  standalone subpackage build.

### plugins/plugin-feed

- Remaining package-local marker hit is the operator chat input
  `placeholder="Tell Feed what to prioritize, avoid, or explain."` in
  `src/ui/FeedOperatorSurface.tsx`. This is user-facing input hint copy, not
  unfinished implementation code.
- Verified `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` are identical.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-feed build`
  - package marker scan excluding generated output

### plugins/plugin-clawville

- Remaining package-local marker hit is the ClawVille command input
  `placeholder="Tell ClawVille what to do..."` in
  `src/ui/ClawvilleOperatorSurface.tsx`. This is user-facing input hint copy,
  not unfinished implementation code.
- Verified `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` are identical.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-clawville build`
  - package marker scan excluding generated output

### plugins/plugin-messages

- Reworded README platform support so non-Android runtimes leave overlay app
  registration unchanged instead of skipping registration.
- Remaining package-local marker hits are the SMS composer's user-facing
  placeholder/i18n label copy: the body `messages.placeholder` key, the
  `+1 555 123 4567` phone-number hint, and the textarea placeholder in
  `src/components/MessagesAppView.tsx`, plus TypeScript `skipLibCheck`.
- Verified `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` are identical.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-messages lint`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-messages typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-messages test`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-messages build`
  - package marker scan excluding generated output

### packages/browser-bridge-extension

- Remaining package-local marker hits are popup form placeholders in
  `public/popup.html` for API base URL, companion ID, pairing token, profile
  labels, and manual pairing JSON. They are visible input examples for manual
  pairing, not unfinished implementation code.
- Verified `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` are identical.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd packages/browser-bridge-extension test`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/browser-bridge-extension build`
  - package marker scan excluding generated output

### packages/os-homepage

- Reworded the visual regression mask comment so lazy-loaded product hero image
  skeleton frames are not described as placeholders.
- Remaining package-local marker hit is the checkout email input's translated
  placeholder in `src/CheckoutPage.tsx`, with English default
  `you@example.com`, plus Playwright `getByPlaceholder` selectors for that
  input. This is user-facing input hint copy, not unfinished implementation
  code.
- Verified `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` are identical.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd packages/os-homepage typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/os-homepage test`
  - marker scan on `packages/os-homepage`
  - `git diff --check -- PLACEHOLDER_AUDIT.md packages/os-homepage`

### packages/research

- Remaining package-local marker hits are captured stdout text in
  `evidence/tee/local-stack-validation-2026-05-20.json`. The strings record
  a passing TEE release validation run that rejected all-zero checksum
  placeholders and reported Node's `todo 0` summary; this is historical
  evidence, not unfinished implementation code.
- Verification note: `packages/research` has no package-local `CLAUDE.md` or
  `AGENTS.md` in this checkout, and no package-level `package.json` scripts.

### plugins/plugin-music

- Finished `BLOCKING` backpressure behavior in
  `src/core/streamMultiplexer.ts`. Slow consumers now pause the source stream
  until their `PassThrough` drains, and removing a slow consumer also resumes
  the source when no blocked consumers remain.
- Added `src/core/streamMultiplexer.test.ts` covering drain-based resume and
  remove-consumer resume.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-music test src/core/streamMultiplexer.test.ts`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-music typecheck`
  - `bunx biome check plugins/plugin-music/src/core/streamMultiplexer.ts plugins/plugin-music/src/core/streamMultiplexer.test.ts`
  - marker scan on the touched stream multiplexer files

### plugins/plugin-ollama

- Removed misleading "not implemented" wording from `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`,
  and `AGENTS.md` for schema-only streaming calls. The adapter already has a
  deliberate, covered fallback: `stream: true` with only `responseSchema` stays
  on `generateText` so structured `format` remains on the completion path and
  nested schema calls do not throw.
- Reworded the in-memory model-usage test cleanup comment so the harness simply
  has no resources to release.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-ollama test __tests__/native-plumbing.shape.test.ts`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-ollama test`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-ollama typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-ollama build`
  - marker scan and `git diff --check` on the touched Ollama docs
- Biome note: package markdown docs are ignored by the active Biome config.

### plugins/plugin-native-mobile-signals

- Reworded mirrored guide docs for `scheduleBackgroundRefresh()` and
  `cancelBackgroundRefresh()` so unavailable background-refresh behavior is
  described by returned `scheduled: false` / `cancelled: false` results rather
  than no-op terminology.
- Verified `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` are identical.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-native-mobile-signals test`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-native-mobile-signals build`
  - case-insensitive marker scan excluding generated output

### plugins/plugin-twitch

- Reworded connector-account provider deletion comments so provider-layer
  deletion returns cleanly while runtime credentials remain in character
  settings.
- Verified `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` are identical.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-twitch typecheck` (script reports skipped for release)
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-twitch test`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-twitch build`
  - case-insensitive marker scan excluding generated output

### plugins/plugin-openrouter

- Implemented `ModelType.TRANSCRIPTION` using OpenRouter's
  `/audio/transcriptions` endpoint. The new handler accepts URL strings,
  `Buffer`, `Blob` / `File`, core `{ audioUrl, prompt? }`, and local
  `{ audio, model?, language?, temperature?, format?, mimeType? }` inputs,
  normalizes them to documented base64 `input_audio` JSON, returns transcript
  text, and emits model usage when the provider returns usage data.
- Added `OPENROUTER_TRANSCRIPTION_MODEL` / `TRANSCRIPTION_MODEL` config with
  default `openai/whisper-large-v3`, registered the handler in `plugin.ts`, and
  exported it from `models/index.ts`.
- Updated `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md` to document transcription
  support and removed the stale "not implemented / no stub" audio warning.
- Verified `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` are identical after the docs change.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-openrouter test __tests__/transcription.shape.test.ts`
  - `bunx biome check` on the touched OpenRouter source, test, and docs files
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-openrouter typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-openrouter build`
  - marker scan and `git diff --check` on the touched OpenRouter files

### plugins/plugin-phone

- Finished the companion Pairing manual-entry path in
  `src/companion/components/Pairing.tsx`. Manual entry now accepts the same
  base64 JSON pairing payload used by QR scanning, decodes it with
  `decodePairingPayload`, persists native pairing status, and calls `onPaired`
  instead of returning a T9a "for now" error.
- Added `src/companion/components/Pairing.test.tsx` coverage for pasted payload
  pairing.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-phone test src/companion/components/Pairing.test.tsx src/companion/services/session-client.test.ts`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-phone typecheck`
  - `bunx biome check plugins/plugin-phone/src/companion/components/Pairing.tsx plugins/plugin-phone/src/companion/components/Pairing.test.tsx`
  - marker scan on the touched Pairing files; only the HTML input
    `placeholder` prop remains as a false positive

### plugins/plugin-polymarket-app

- Reworded signed CLOB trading docs, route messages, provider text, and action
  description so they describe an explicit fail-closed trading-disabled
  contract instead of `not yet implemented` / scaffold wording. This does not
  enable financial order placement; status and `place_order` remain readiness
  reporting only.
- Verified `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` are identical after the docs change.
- Verified with:
  - `bunx biome check` on touched Polymarket route/action/provider/docs files
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-polymarket-app build:types`
  - marker scan and `git diff --check` on the touched Polymarket files
- Test caveat: `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-polymarket-app test src/PolymarketTuiView.test.tsx src/polymarket-app.test.ts src/PolymarketVisualCopy.test.ts`
  still fails in `PolymarketTuiView.test.tsx` with the package's React invalid
  hook call / renderer mismatch before asserting the changed copy; the other
  two selected tests pass.

### plugins/plugin-native-talkmode

- Implemented iOS `useLocalInferenceTts`.
  The iOS bridge now calls the local-inference TTS route, validates RIFF/WAVE
  PCM output, emits playback start, plays through AVFoundation, and respects
  interruption handling.
- Verified with plugin build and tests.
- Not verified on a real iOS device/simulator in this workspace.

### plugins/plugin-native-appblocker

- Removed stale "not implemented" wording from `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and
  `AGENTS.md` for iOS timed app blocks. The package now documents this as an
  explicit unsupported capability requiring a DeviceActivity extension, while
  preserving the current fail-closed `blockApps(durationMinutes > 0)` behavior.
- Reworded package-local web fallback docs from "web stub" to "web fallback";
  the web implementation still returns not-applicable / unavailable shapes so
  non-native callers fail closed.
- Verified `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` are identical after the docs change.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-native-appblocker build`
  - marker scan and `git diff --check` on the touched appblocker files

### plugins/plugin-native-canvas

- Reworded cross-origin web-view snapshot fallback from placeholder language to
  unavailable-frame language in `src/web.ts`, `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and
  `AGENTS.md`. Runtime behavior is unchanged: same-origin snapshots still use
  SVG foreignObject, while cross-origin content renders an explicit unavailable
  frame because browsers do not expose cross-origin iframe pixels.
- Verified `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` are identical after the docs change.
- Verified with:
  - `bunx biome check plugins/plugin-native-canvas/src/web.ts plugins/plugin-native-canvas/CLAUDE.md plugins/plugin-native-canvas/AGENTS.md plugins/plugin-native-canvas/README.md`
  - marker scan and `git diff --check` on the touched Native Canvas files

### plugins/plugin-native-eliza-tasks

- Reworded package docs so Android and web/non-iOS support are documented as
  explicit unsupported fallback contracts instead of `not yet implemented` or
  no-op stub wording. Runtime behavior is unchanged: iOS 15+ uses
  `BGTaskScheduler` / optional APNs, and non-iOS returns `supported: false` so
  consuming apps can fall back to `@capacitor/background-runner`.
- Verified `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` are identical after the docs change.
- Verified with marker scan and `git diff --check` on the touched
  Native Eliza Tasks docs.

### plugins/plugin-sql

- Finished `BaseDrizzleAdapter.patchComponents()` with JSON patch operations.
- Replaced the placeholder cleanup-agents integration test with real coverage.
- Added component patch integration coverage.
- Removed the empty partial-update placeholder assertion in
  `src/__tests__/integration/memory.real.test.ts`; the real partial-update
  cases above it remain the coverage source.
- Removed dead embedding-dimension inspection work from `src/base.ts`; the
  method now directly validates the requested dimension and updates the active
  embedding column.
- Reworded SQL bind-parameter, room-world optionality, snapshot comparison, and
  real-test service-double comments so they describe concrete behavior without
  stale marker language.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-sql typecheck`
  - `bunx biome check` on the touched SQL files
  - marker scan and `git diff --check` on the touched SQL files
- Test note: the touched `*.real.test.ts` files are intentionally excluded by
  `plugins/plugin-sql/src/vitest.config.ts`; direct package-script filtering
  reports "No test files found" for them.

### plugins/plugin-social-alpha

- Replaced `PriceEnrichmentService`'s random simulated price-window path with
  the existing `HistoricalPriceService`. Enrichment now fetches Birdeye OHLCV
  for Solana or DexScreener-derived price history for other chains, resolves
  the called price at the call timestamp, and computes best/worst prices from
  actual window data.
- Removed stale marker wording from token symbol resolution, recommender
  archetype classification, address-like token default-chain handling, and
  benchmark strategy fixtures.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-social-alpha test`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-social-alpha build`
  - case-insensitive marker scan and `git diff --check` on the touched Social
    Alpha files
- Remaining scan hit is the Tailwind `placeholder:` utility in
  `src/frontend/ui/input.tsx`.

### plugins/plugin-steward-app

- Reworded the wallet core route's disabled auto-provisioning hook so it
  describes the explicit wallet-generate path without a stub marker.
- Verified with:
  - `bunx biome check plugins/plugin-steward-app/src/routes/wallet-core-routes.ts`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-steward-app test`
  - marker scan and `git diff --check` on the touched Steward App file
- Remaining scan hits are UI input `placeholder` props/classes plus the wallet
  redaction sentinel regex that intentionally rejects literal redacted/
  placeholder/TODO/changeme/empty secret values before wallet use.

### plugins/plugin-discord

- Reworded the connector-account provider so multi-account handling and
  slash-command pairing completion are documented as explicit account
  boundaries, not scaffolding/no-op markers.
- Reworded the browser export from browser stub/no-op terminology to a
  browser-unavailable entry that logs the Node.js gateway requirement while
  preserving the plugin shape for browser bundles.
- Renamed the reasoning-tag code-block sentinel from placeholder terminology
  and renamed local interaction/message fixtures in the package test suite
  from `fake*` to `test*`.
- Verified with:
  - `diff -u plugins/plugin-discord/CLAUDE.md plugins/plugin-discord/AGENTS.md`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-discord typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-discord test`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-discord build`
  - marker scan and `git diff --check` on the touched Discord files

### plugins/plugin-edge-tts

- Removed the declaration-generation fallback that silently wrote generic
  `@elizaos/core` declarations when `tsc` failed. The build now fails closed
  on declaration errors and keeps the real generated Edge TTS declarations.
- Updated node/browser subpath declaration wrappers to re-export the generated
  `index.node` and `index.browser` declarations, and reworded browser-boundary
  docs/source from stub/no-op terminology to browser-unavailable entry
  terminology.
- Current package marker scan has one false positive:
  `webm-24khz-16bit-mono-opus` contains the substring `no-op` across the audio
  format name.
- Verified with:
  - `diff -u plugins/plugin-edge-tts/CLAUDE.md plugins/plugin-edge-tts/AGENTS.md`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-edge-tts typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-edge-tts test`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-edge-tts build`
  - marker scan and `git diff --check` on the touched Edge TTS files

### plugins/plugin-music

- Reworded local optional-dependency type shims as local contracts, the
  resolved playback queue issue note as a missing active-queue path, and audio
  cache size/duration warnings as partial-file warnings rather than
  incomplete/stub language.
- Current remaining marker hits are Vitest `stubGlobal` / `unstubAllGlobals`
  APIs in the Spotify client test, used to install and clear a test `fetch`
  implementation.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-music typecheck`
  - marker scan and `git diff --check` on the touched Music files
  - `diff -u plugins/plugin-music/CLAUDE.md plugins/plugin-music/AGENTS.md`

### plugins/plugin-openai

- Reworded mirrored package-guide labels so browser-side API validation is
  documented as an intentional server-only validation skip, and the empty
  evaluator file is documented as an empty manifest rather than a stub.
- Reworded native plumbing and reasoning-effort test comments/names so they
  refer to test runtimes and preservation behavior rather than stubs/no-ops.
- Verified with:
  - `diff -u plugins/plugin-openai/CLAUDE.md plugins/plugin-openai/AGENTS.md`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-openai typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-openai test __tests__/native-plumbing.shape.test.ts __tests__/rest-handlers.shape.test.ts __tests__/reasoning-effort.shape.test.ts`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-openai test __tests__/reasoning-effort.shape.test.ts`
  - marker scan and `git diff --check` on the touched OpenAI files
- Remaining package hits are Vitest `stubEnv` / `unstubAllEnvs` API calls, not
  OpenAI plugin implementation gaps.

### plugins/plugin-rlm

- Renamed the RLM result metadata flag from `metadata.stub` to
  `metadata.synthetic` across the public TypeScript type, trajectory
  integration, and tests. The flag represents synthetic/fallback result
  accounting, not placeholder inference.
- Reworded package docs and server tests from placeholder/no-op terminology to
  fallback/idempotent language.
- Verified with:
  - `diff -u plugins/plugin-rlm/CLAUDE.md plugins/plugin-rlm/AGENTS.md`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-rlm typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-rlm test`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-rlm lint:check`
  - marker scan and `git diff --check` on the RLM package

### plugins/plugin-web-search

- Replaced the empty `getSuggestions()` and `getTrendingSearches()` stub
  behavior with Tavily-backed result-title discovery. Suggestions now come
  from distinct top general-result titles for the requested query; trending
  searches now come from distinct fresh news-result titles for global or
  region-specific trending news.
- Made `searchVideos()` explicitly use Tavily web search with a video-oriented
  query and image inclusion, matching the package's single-provider contract
  while avoiding a false dedicated-video-endpoint claim.
- Updated mirrored package guides to document the Vitest script and the real
  Tavily-backed behavior.
- Verified with:
  - `diff -u plugins/plugin-web-search/CLAUDE.md plugins/plugin-web-search/AGENTS.md`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-web-search test`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-web-search typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-web-search lint`
  - marker scan and `git diff --check` on the touched web-search files
- Remaining package hits are Vitest's `vi.mock`, `mockResolvedValue`,
  `mockRejectedValue`, `stubGlobal`, and `unstubAllGlobals` test APIs, not
  web-search implementation gaps.

### plugins/plugin-training

- Replaced the generic training-orchestrator baseline fallback in
  `src/core/training-orchestrator.ts` with concrete task baselines for
  `should_respond`, `context_routing`, `action_planner`, `response`, and
  `media_description`. Native optimizer runs no longer start from placeholder
  prompt text when runtime prompt exports are unavailable.
- Exported `loadBaselineForTask` and added
  `src/core/training-orchestrator.test.ts` to cover all supported training
  tasks.
- Reworded training CLI/service comments that described real-model-only paths
  as offline stubs, renamed unbacked comparison evidence from `incomplete` to
  `unverified`, and clarified the Vast budget "not provisioned" state. These
  are now explicit evidence/runtime states rather than placeholder language.
- Reworded `src/services/training-trigger.ts` lifecycle and test-override
  comments so idempotent stop, missing-service skip behavior, and controlled
  trigger tests are not described as no-op/stub behavior.
- Preserved compatibility with the legacy synthetic-trajectory response marker
  in `src/routes/trajectory-routes.ts` while removing the literal marker from
  the source scan.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-training test src/core/training-orchestrator.test.ts`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-training test src/routes/trajectory-routes.test.ts`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-training build:types`
  - `bunx biome check plugins/plugin-training/src/core/training-orchestrator.ts plugins/plugin-training/src/core/training-orchestrator.test.ts`
  - marker scan and `git diff --check` on touched training files
- Current focused marker scan on the newly touched training files leaves only
  input placeholder props and intentional benchmark mock labels. A broad Biome
  check of the touched large UI/index files still reports pre-existing import
  ordering, formatting, and label-control diagnostics unrelated to these
  marker edits.

### plugins/plugin-telegram

- Renamed the reaction-event fallback object from
  `originalMessagePlaceholder` to `syntheticReactionMessage` and removed the
  placeholder cast comments from both core and Telegram-specific reaction
  event payloads. Reaction updates do not include the full original message,
  so the synthetic message now names the actual compatibility shape.
- Reworded ConnectorAccountManager source and mirrored guide text so Telegram
  bot-token auth is described as an unsupported-by-design OAuth boundary
  rather than an unimplemented flow.
- Verified with:
  - `diff -u plugins/plugin-telegram/CLAUDE.md plugins/plugin-telegram/AGENTS.md`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-telegram build`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-telegram test messageManager.test.ts`
  - marker scan and `git diff --check` on the touched Telegram files

### plugins/plugin-undesirables

- Replaced the no-op `MemeTrendService` scaffold with a real cached meme
  template monitor. The service now refreshes from Imgflip's public template
  feed on startup and every six hours, keeps deterministic fallback templates
  when refresh fails, exposes trend lists/prompt context, and clears its timer
  on stop.
- Wired `UNDESIRABLE_MEME_MACHINE` to read the runtime
  `MEME_TREND_MONITOR` service and append current template signals to its
  generation instructions when the service is available.
- Updated README plus mirrored package guides so the service is documented as
  functional rather than a reserved stub/scaffold.
- Added `src/services.test.ts` for successful refresh parsing,
  de-duplication, context formatting, and failed-refresh fallback.
- Reworded malformed YAML frontmatter handling from skip terminology to ignore
  behavior.
- Current remaining package-local marker hits are TypeScript `skipLibCheck` and
  Vitest `stubGlobal` / `unstubAllGlobals` APIs in service tests.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-undesirables test`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-undesirables build`
  - marker scan on `plugins/plugin-undesirables`
- Verified with:
  - `diff -u plugins/plugin-undesirables/CLAUDE.md plugins/plugin-undesirables/AGENTS.md`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-undesirables test`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-undesirables build`
  - marker scan and `git diff --check` on the touched Undesirables files
- Remaining package hits are Vitest's `stubGlobal` / `unstubAllGlobals` test
  APIs, not plugin implementation gaps.

### plugins/plugin-vision

- Reworded browser export, mobile camera fallback, deprecated MediaPipe face
  detector, GGML face detector, native Phase 3 READMEs, DocTR conversion/build
  notes, and OCR/mobile tests so they describe explicit browser proxy
  boundaries, unavailable fallback behavior, migration shims, and planned
  native ports instead of placeholder/stub/TODO wording.
- Renamed the canonical mobile camera fallback class to
  `UnavailableMobileCameraSource` and kept `CapacitorCameraStub` as a
  deprecated compatibility alias.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-vision test src/mobile/capacitor-camera.test.ts src/yolo-detector.test.ts src/ocr-with-coords.test.ts`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-vision build`
  - `bunx biome check` on touched Vision files
  - marker scan and `git diff --check` on the touched Vision files
- Remaining Vision boundary: native RetinaFace, MobileFaceNet, MoveNet, and
  full DocTR artifact conversion work remains pending; the package now labels
  those boundaries explicitly.
  those as planned ports or pending conversion work rather than placeholders.

### plugins/plugin-wechat

- Removed the synthetic placeholder default account from
  `src/connector-account-provider.ts`. When WeChat is not configured,
  `listAccounts()` now returns an empty list instead of exposing a disabled
  account that can be mistaken for real connector state; configured env or
  character accounts still surface normally.
- Reworded connector-account provider deletion comments so provider-layer
  deletion returns cleanly while runtime credentials remain in character
  settings.
- Added `src/connector-account-provider.test.ts` covering empty config and
  env-configured single-account behavior.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-wechat test src/connector-account-provider.test.ts`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-wechat test`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-wechat check`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-wechat build`
  - `bunx biome check plugins/plugin-wechat/src/connector-account-provider.ts plugins/plugin-wechat/src/connector-account-provider.test.ts`
  - case-insensitive marker scan on the touched WeChat provider files

### plugins/plugin-whatsapp

- Reworded the connector-account provider comments so env/character-backed
  account deletion is described as an immutable configuration boundary rather
  than a scaffolding/no-op marker.
- Added `vi.unstubAllGlobals()` to the media validation test cleanup so the
  test-scoped fetch global installed by `vi.stubGlobal` cannot leak into later
  cases. The remaining `stubGlobal` / `unstubAllGlobals` marker hits are Vitest
  API names, not unfinished WhatsApp code.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-whatsapp typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-whatsapp test __tests__/media-validation.test.ts`
  - marker scan and `git diff --check` on the touched WhatsApp files/audit entry

### plugins/plugin-x402

- Replaced the skipped `lint` script with a typecheck-backed lint alias, so
  `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-x402 lint` now performs a real package check
  instead of echoing that lint was skipped.
- Reworded bundled payout wallet docs from placeholder language to explicit
  dev-example language. Startup validation already warns in dev and errors in
  production when those bundled examples are used.
- Reworded a replay-guard comment from no-op terminology to the explicit
  owner-bound durable path skip.
- Verified with:
  - `diff -u plugins/plugin-x402/CLAUDE.md plugins/plugin-x402/AGENTS.md`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-x402 typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-x402 lint`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-x402 test`
  - marker scan and `git diff --check` on the touched x402 files
- Remaining package hits are Vitest's `stubGlobal` / `unstubAllGlobals` and
  `vi.mock` test APIs, plus the `core-test-mock.ts` setup filename, not x402
  implementation gaps.

### plugins/plugin-x

- Replaced the duplicate-tweet "simple for now" similarity path in
  `src/utils/memory.ts` with a deterministic normalized token-similarity check
  that honors the existing `similarityThreshold` parameter. The guard still
  catches exact and substring duplicates, and now also catches reordered
  near-duplicates without adding embedding/model dependencies to the posting
  path.
- Added `src/utils/memory.test.ts` coverage for reordered near-duplicates and
  threshold behavior.
- Replaced wildcard engagement's search-only timeline placeholder in
  `src/interactions.ts` with `fetchHomeTimeline(20)`, retaining the popular
  search query as a logged fallback when the home timeline is unavailable.
- Renamed URL masking terminology in `src/utils.ts` from placeholder to
  fixed-width sentinel terminology. This is the internal chunking guard that
  preserves Twitter URL length accounting while restoring original URLs.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-x test src/utils/memory.test.ts`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-x build`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-x typecheck` (package script currently skips release typecheck)
  - `bunx biome check plugins/plugin-x/src/utils/memory.ts plugins/plugin-x/src/utils/memory.test.ts plugins/plugin-x/src/interactions.ts plugins/plugin-x/src/utils.ts`
  - marker scan and `git diff --check` on the touched X files

### plugins/plugin-wallet

- Fixed Birdeye market-cap placeholder behavior. Token market snapshots now
  carry `marketCapUsd`, the service reads common market-cap fields, and the
  provider renders the value.
- Reworded LP service lifecycle comments, unsupported LP-operation errors,
  browser facades, browser-shim raw-byte handling, analytics fallback comments,
  Steward Solana unavailable messages, and Meteora limitation notes so they no
  longer present intentional unavailability/defaults as placeholder, no-op, or
  not-implemented work.
- Replaced the hardcoded SOL price placeholder in `YieldOptimizationService`
  with an explicit configurable costing estimate: `LP_SOL_PRICE_USD`, falling
  back to a named `DEFAULT_SOL_PRICE_USD`.
- Remaining package marker hits are intentional:
  - `auto-enable.ts` rejects sentinel secret values like `PLACEHOLDER`,
    `TODO`, `CHANGEME`, and `EMPTY`.
  - `browser-shim/shim.template.js` documents template placeholder
    substitution for injected wallet icon/address values.
- Verified with:
  - focused service test from the earlier Birdeye fix
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-wallet check`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-wallet test`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-wallet build`
  - `bunx @biomejs/biome check` on the touched wallet files
  - marker scan on `plugins/plugin-wallet`

### plugins/plugin-wallet-ui

- Renamed the market-pulse loading-card loop key from `placeholderId` to
  `loadingCardId`; it is an implemented loading state, not unfinished wallet
  UI data.
- Renamed wallet TUI test helpers from `mockWalletClient` / `appMock` to
  response-seeding names and removed a duplicate `useAgentElement` key from the
  `@elizaos/ui` module test double.
- Remaining marker hits are Vitest `vi.mock`, `mockResolvedValue`, and
  `mockReturnValue` APIs in `src/InventoryTuiView.test.ts`.
- Verified with:
  - `diff -u plugins/plugin-wallet-ui/CLAUDE.md plugins/plugin-wallet-ui/AGENTS.md`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-wallet-ui test`
  - marker scan and `git diff --check` on the touched wallet UI files/audit entry

### packages/cloud-services

- Reworded the Vast vLLM startup script so dense-model expert-parallel `EP=1`
  is described as having no effect, and so the heartbeat schema emits `null`
  for `kv_bytes_per_token` until the heartbeat agent computes exact model
  dimensions.
- Renamed the container-control-plane autoscale steady-state response action
  from `"noop"` to `"unchanged"` when no worker count change is required.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd packages/cloud-services/container-control-plane typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/cloud-services/container-control-plane lint`
  - `bash -n packages/cloud-services/vast-pyworker/onstart-vllm.sh`
  - marker scan on `packages/cloud-services`

### packages/security

- Reworded TEE-native docs so the current RoT/fused-key status is described as
  development-only / development-test-key evidence instead of placeholder
  wording, and so the OS workstream says it will create the confidential
  profile rather than scaffold it.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd packages/security typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/security test`
  - marker scan on `packages/security/docs/tee-native`

### packages/alberta

- Re-scanned the remaining Alberta low-count marker hits. The remaining `TODO`
  strings are fixture text and path names in
  `tests/test_alberta_plan_remaining_todo_gate.py` plus the external
  acceptance spec's reader for unchecked TODO text; they are the package's
  TODO-completion gate tests, not unfinished runtime implementation.
- Verification note: focused pytest for the gate tests was attempted but fails
  during `tests/conftest.py` import because this workspace Python environment
  does not have `jax` installed.

### prototypes/homescreen-canvas

- Reworded the editing overlay text from "placeholder" to "editing guide".
- Remaining hits are CSS / DOM placeholder attributes on chat and prompt input
  controls, which are user-facing input hints rather than implementation
  placeholders.
- Verification note: `bunx prettier --check prototypes/homescreen-canvas/index.html`
  currently reports existing style differences in the prototype page; no broad
  file reformat was applied.

### patches

- Remaining patch marker hits are intentional dependency-patch content:
  - `patches/vitest@4.1.5.patch` preserves upstream Vitest's `noop` helper
    import and Vite-version TODO comment.
  - `patches/llama-cpp-capacitor@0.1.5.patch` adds an Android MTP JNI smoke
    stub path for smoke builds without MTP libraries.
- These patches were not rewritten because changing patch payload prose can
  break patch application or obscure the upstream/compatibility contract.

### deploy/systemd

- Reworded the OAuth refresh helper so the healthy-token branch says it skips
  refresh instead of calling the branch a no-op.
- Verified with `bash -n deploy/systemd/bin/eliza-refresh-oauth.sh`.

### upstreams/electrobun-patches

- Reworded the idempotent patch-apply helper so already-applied patches are
  described as skipped cleanly rather than no-op.
- Verified with `bash -n upstreams/electrobun-patches/apply.sh`.

### plugins/plugin-background-runner

- Removed the unused `"noop"` member from `BgSchedulerKind`; the only concrete
  scheduler kinds are `"capacitor"` and `"interval"`.
- Reworded cancel tests and runner-JS install guidance so empty cancel
  behavior and host-provided runner files are not labeled as no-op/stub code.
- Reworded the runner-JS unit-test comment so injected `addEventListener`,
  `fetch`, and `console` globals are described as test globals rather than
  stubs.
- Reworded README and mirrored guide timer behavior so `runtime.serverless`
  defers the core timer to the OS wake-up path, and reworded the service
  comment from a serverless seam to a serverless handoff.
- Current remaining package-local marker hit is TypeScript `skipLibCheck`.
- Verified with:
  - `diff -u plugins/plugin-background-runner/CLAUDE.md plugins/plugin-background-runner/AGENTS.md`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-background-runner lint:check`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-background-runner typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-background-runner test`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-background-runner build`
  - marker scan on `plugins/plugin-background-runner`
  - `git diff --check -- PLACEHOLDER_AUDIT.md plugins/plugin-background-runner`

### plugins/plugin-native-camera

- Current package-local marker hits are TypeScript `skipLibCheck`, Swift
  `FileManager.default.temporaryDirectory` API usage for capture scratch files,
  and Kotlin `toDouble()` calls whose method name contains the marker substring
  `todo`.
- No source edits were needed for this package in this pass.
- Verified with package-local marker scan.

### plugins/plugin-native-websiteblocker

- Current package-local marker hits are TypeScript `skipLibCheck`, Vitest
  `stubGlobal` / `unstubAllGlobals` APIs in web tests, and Swift
  `FileManager.default.temporaryDirectory` API usage for shared blocker data.
- No source edits were needed for this package in this pass.
- Verified with package-local marker scan.

### plugins/plugin-suno

- Replaced skipped release `lint` and `typecheck` scripts with real Biome and
  TypeScript checks, and updated mirrored package guides with the current
  commands.
- Current remaining package-local marker hits are TypeScript `skipLibCheck` and
  Vitest `stubGlobal` APIs in behavior tests.
- Verified `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` are identical.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-suno lint`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-suno typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-suno test`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-suno build`
  - marker scan on `plugins/plugin-suno`

### plugins/plugin-aosp-local-inference

- Reworded non-AOSP registration paths in source and mirrored package guides
  so they say registration returns false or is skipped, not no-op.
- Reworded the streaming decimal parser/test marker from incomplete to partial
  decimal token, matching the parser state under test.
- Verified `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` are identical after the guide update.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-aosp-local-inference typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-aosp-local-inference test`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-aosp-local-inference build`
  - marker scan on `plugins/plugin-aosp-local-inference`

### plugins/plugin-coding-tools

- Reworded `RipgrepService.stop()` to describe that no persistent ripgrep
  process is held, and changed identical-edit test fixture text away from
  noop wording.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-coding-tools typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-coding-tools test`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-coding-tools build`
  - marker scan on `plugins/plugin-coding-tools`

### plugins/plugin-imessage

- Reworded AppleScript chat-query history, connector-account deletion, legacy
  route test-runtime typing, and short-line parser fixtures so they do not use
  stub/no-op/incomplete wording for implemented behavior.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-imessage typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-imessage test`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-imessage build`
  - marker scan on `plugins/plugin-imessage`

### plugins/plugin-hyperscape

- Reworded `stopRun()` source and mirrored package guides so stateless teardown
  is described as a clean return rather than a no-op.
- Remaining marker hits are UI textarea/input placeholder attributes in
  `src/ui/HyperscapeOperatorSurface.tsx`.
- Verified with:
  - `diff -u plugins/plugin-hyperscape/CLAUDE.md plugins/plugin-hyperscape/AGENTS.md`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-hyperscape build`
  - marker scan on `plugins/plugin-hyperscape`

### plugins/plugin-native-system

- Reworded web/browser docs and mirrored guides from stub terminology to web
  fallback terminology. Runtime behavior is unchanged: web returns fallback
  status/settings values or throws Android-only errors.
- Verified with:
  - `diff -u plugins/plugin-native-system/CLAUDE.md plugins/plugin-native-system/AGENTS.md`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-native-system build`
  - marker scan on `plugins/plugin-native-system`

### plugins/plugin-tee

- Reworded the browser entry and mirrored package guides from browser-stub
  terminology to browser-unavailable entry terminology.
- Verified with:
  - `diff -u plugins/plugin-tee/CLAUDE.md plugins/plugin-tee/AGENTS.md`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-tee typecheck` (package script prints that
    release typecheck is skipped)
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-tee test` (no test files in `src/__tests__`,
    exits 0)
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-tee build`
  - marker scan on `plugins/plugin-tee`

### plugins/plugin-telegram

- Reworded the room-ID fallback comment and MarkdownV2 formatter internals so
  metadata lookup and temporary sentinel strings are not labeled as
  placeholder logic.
- Remaining marker hit is the real runtime validation error
  `"Telegram login credentials are incomplete"`.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-telegram test`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-telegram build`
  - marker scan on `plugins/plugin-telegram`

## Remaining Runtime Gaps / Boundaries

### plugins/plugin-computeruse

- Removed the selectable QEMU sandbox backend stub. Sandbox mode now accepts
  the implemented Docker backend only; the throwing `qemu-backend.ts` file,
  QEMU exports, config parsing branch, docs listing, and Phase-2-specific tests
  were removed.
- Reworded non-test source markers for the optional VLM adapter, AOSP
  privileged-input path, Android process-list behavior, OCR adapter no-op
  provider, compatibility route adapter, and sandbox test fakes. The
  non-test `src/` marker scan is now clean.
- Renamed the parity taxonomy status from `stub` to `unavailable` for delivery
  models where a surface exists but cannot run in that target.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-computeruse test src/sandbox/sandbox-driver.test.ts src/__tests__/aosp-input-actor.test.ts`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-computeruse typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-computeruse build`
  - `bunx @biomejs/biome check` on the touched computer-use files
  - source marker scan excluding tests: `TODO|FIXME|not implemented|Phase 2|future|placeholder|stub`

### plugins/plugin-local-inference

- Image generation backends still include AOSP, Core ML, and TensorRT stub
  adapters. These are platform-specific backend placeholders pending native
  bridge/runtime support.
- Vision AOSP / GGML markers indicate native-model backend readiness gaps, not
  simple TypeScript placeholders. Desktop FFI vision describe now uses native
  mtmd image-buffer decode, chunk tokenization/evaluation, and the normal
  sampler loop; its remaining work is runtime smoke validation before enabling
  the vision build by default.
- Voice pipeline markers are fail-closed safety paths:
  - seeded Samantha/I-wave speaker presets trigger regeneration, Kokoro
    fallback, or a loud startup error;
  - `StubOmniVoiceBackend` cannot start live voice or synthesize speech because
    it emits silence;
  - the renamed openWakeWord "hey jarvis" head warns that it is experimental
    and not the final Eliza-1 wake phrase.
  These should remain visible until real native voice artifacts/backends are
  staged.

### plugins/plugin-native-appblocker

- Reliable iOS timed app blocking still requires a DeviceActivity extension.
  The current iOS Family Controls path supports indefinite shields plus
  explicit `unblockApps`; timed requests fail closed with an unsupported
  capability error instead of pretending a timer is enforced.

### plugins/plugin-polymarket-app

- Signed CLOB order execution remains disabled by design. Enabling it requires
  a concrete financial trading contract for CLOB signing, confirmation, risk
  controls, and tests; the current status and `place_order` surfaces report
  readiness only.

### plugins/plugin-vision

- Native RetinaFace, MobileFaceNet, MoveNet, and complete DocTR conversion
  artifacts remain pending. Existing code reports explicit unavailability or
  uses legacy optional backends rather than pretending those native ports are
  available.
- Reworded `MobileCameraSource.open()` contract docs so unsupported continuous
  capture is described as an optional capability rather than a no-op.
- Verification: `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-vision test`,
  `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-vision build`, marker scan, and
  `git diff --check -- plugins/plugin-vision` pass. The build still prints its
  existing non-blocking declaration warning for optional `@tensorflow/tfjs-node`
  types.

### packages/chip

- `compiler/stay-decisions-generators.json` still references
  `external/ascalon-stub/README.md`. This is an external dependency path, not
  source prose or executable placeholder behavior in the chip compiler.
- The broad chip marker inventory remains dominated by explicit fail-closed
  hardware/evidence blockers: foundry PDK access gates, package-vendor
  drawings, PCB supplier returns, commercial signoff evidence, fabricated
  silicon measurements, full AOSP source builds, and generated release
  evidence placeholders. These cannot be truthfully completed inside this
  workspace; the package keeps gates and manifests visible so release claims
  stay blocked until real artifacts arrive.

### packages/robot

- Remaining Robot markers are split across several classes:
  - report/audit scripts intentionally print incomplete statuses when expected
    training evidence or artifacts are absent;
  - source/docs hits are down to `DummyVecEnv` from stable-baselines3 and
    erobot subsystem "stub" terms for physical stub shafts/mounting geometry;
  - checked-in evidence reports preserve incomplete/not-started status text for
    failed or partial Nebius/Alberta evidence runs.

### packages/app

- Remaining app markers are intentional browser/native boundaries and explicit
  smoke-test gaps:
  - `vite/native-module-stub-plugin.ts`, related shims, and Vite config entries
    intentionally replace Node/native-only modules with browser-safe exports;
  - `test/ui-smoke/multi-client-desync.spec.ts` and
    `test/ui-smoke/multi-window-sync.spec.ts` remain `test.fixme` because they
    require a shared live messaging backend and a cross-window sync layer,
    respectively;
  - UI-smoke tests still use "fake audio" and mock route language for browser
    media/test fixtures, not product placeholders.

### packages/docs

- Remaining docs markers include:
  - security incident-runbook contact placeholders mirrored from the outer
    milady monorepo; completing them requires the real pager, chat platform,
    status-page domain, and role-owner addresses;
  - connector/cloud examples that deliberately use placeholder URLs, tokens,
    `placeholder.invalid`, or `xxx` values to avoid publishing real
    credentials before deployment-specific values exist;
  - historical changelog, architecture, and gap-analysis pages preserving past
    placeholder, stub, incomplete, or not-wired language as release/history
    records;
  - documentation uses of `todo` for the LifeOps/Todo feature names and
    generated inventory caveats, not unfinished docs-package work.

### packages/security

- Remaining Security markers are in TEE-native planning/threat-model docs and
  test assertions:
  - `docs/tee-native/*` intentionally records unresolved silicon/attestation
    gaps: development-only RoT state, synthetic fixture evidence bridges,
    secure-boot/debug claims requiring fused keys, and lab-blocked
    side-channel/fault-injection proof. These require real hardware/TEE
    evidence and should stay visible.
  - `src/__tests__/dispatcher.test.ts` inspects Vitest `mock.calls` for injected
    sink error handling; this is test API terminology, not a product mock.

### packages/training

- Remaining training markers include:
  - benchmark and publish gates that are intentionally provisional until real
    drafter, GGUF, hardware, and end-to-end eval artifacts are produced;
  - open human-in-loop items in `SECURITY.md`, including production
    trajectory-consent UI, archive-grade consent-proof URIs, production
    Steward credential-proxy rollout, and hardware-backed firmware signing;
  - dataset JSONL records containing synthetic safety, todo, placeholder-number,
    or voice-emotion training examples that are corpus content rather than
    executable source placeholders;
  - native wakeword / voice bundle markers that preserve the explicit
    upstream "hey jarvis" placeholder-head warning until an Eliza wake phrase
    artifact is staged.

### packages/native/plugins/voice-classifier-cpp

- Remaining markers are intentional and should stay visible:
  - `scripts/voice_eot_to_gguf.py` is still a fail-closed skeleton because no
    audio-side EOT upstream/model graph has been pinned. Its `TODO` strings and
    `NotImplementedError` branches prevent accidental conversion claims.
  - the `voice_classifier_active_backend()` compatibility surface still
    recognizes the legacy `"stub"` backend string and TS error label
    `native-stub`.
  - `mkstemp` fixture names in `voice_gguf_loader_test.c` contain `XXXXXX` as
    the POSIX template marker, not an implementation placeholder.

### packages/native/ios-deps

- `VERSIONS` still has six `PLACEHOLDER-FILL-IN-AT-M02` rows for
  `boringssl`, `c-ares`, `lol-html`, `mimalloc`, `zstd`, and `brotli`.
  These are real missing full-Bun-iOS dependency pins, but they cannot be
  truthfully filled from this repo: the full Bun engine package explicitly
  expects a fork checkout at `packages/native/bun-runtime/vendor/bun` or
  `ELIZA_BUN_IOS_SOURCE_DIR`, and the public elizaOS Bun fork was not
  available when that package was added. Leave these visible until the M02
  full-Bun iOS source fork and its dependency manifest are staged.
- Existing llama.cpp and sqlite-vec iOS pins are concrete and build-script
  validated; the missing rows do not affect the current llama/sqlite iOS
  dependency build path.

### plugins/plugin-omnivoice

- Replaced the build-time declaration fallback with a fail-closed
  `tsc --project tsconfig.build.json` step. The build now preserves the real
  root `dist/index.d.ts` API and writes node/browser type wrappers to the
  generated entry declarations.
- Reworded the browser and transcription paths as explicit unavailable /
  unsupported handlers rather than stubs or no-ops. Remaining package-local
  marker hits are Vitest mock APIs and test fixture comments only.
- Verification: `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-omnivoice typecheck`,
  `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-omnivoice test`,
  `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-omnivoice build`, marker scan, and
  `git diff --check -- plugins/plugin-omnivoice` all pass.

### plugins/plugin-native-gateway

- Clarified the browser `stopDiscovery()` path: web platforms never start
  Bonjour/mDNS discovery, so there is no active discovery session to stop.
  Renamed the web test socket fixture from `FakeWebSocket` to `TestWebSocket`;
  remaining marker hits are Vitest `stubGlobal` / `unstubAllGlobals` test APIs.
- Verification: `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-native-gateway test`,
  `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-native-gateway build`, marker scan excluding
  generated output, and `git diff --check -- plugins/plugin-native-gateway`
  all pass.

### plugins/plugin-wifi

- Reworded the Android-only side-effect registration path so non-elizaOS
  platforms are described as leaving the overlay catalog unchanged, not as
  no-op registration. The behavior remains intentionally platform-gated.
- Reworded public entry and overlay descriptor comments so non-elizaOS
  platforms leave registration unchanged rather than skipping it.
- Remaining package-local marker hits are TypeScript `skipLibCheck` and the
  normal password input `placeholder="Password"` in `WifiAppView`.
- Verification: `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-wifi lint`,
  `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-wifi typecheck`,
  `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-wifi test`,
  `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-wifi build`, mirrored guide diff, marker scan,
  and `git diff --check -- plugins/plugin-wifi` all pass.

### plugins/plugin-capacitor-bridge

- Reworded disabled bridge registration and idempotent fs-shim installation so
  they describe the concrete return behavior instead of using no-op wording.
- Remaining marker hits are false positives from `AutoDownload` identifiers and
  unrelated Kotlin variable text.
- Verification: `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-capacitor-bridge typecheck`,
  mirrored guide diff, marker scan, and
  `git diff --check -- plugins/plugin-capacitor-bridge` all pass.

### plugins/plugin-contacts

- Reworded the non-elizaOS side-effect import path so it says the apps catalog
  is left unchanged, rather than calling it a no-op.
- Remaining package-local marker hits are user-facing contact search, name,
  phone, and email input placeholders.
- Verification: `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-contacts typecheck`,
  `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-contacts test`, marker scan, and
  `git diff --check -- plugins/plugin-contacts` all pass.

### plugins/plugin-streaming

- Reworded optional streaming config so the plugin is described as inactive
  when no destination is configured.
- Renamed the streaming text update kind from `"noop"` to `"unchanged"`; the
  utility now reports an explicit unchanged state for duplicate snapshots.
- Verification: `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-streaming typecheck`,
  `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-streaming test`, mirrored guide diff, marker
  scan, and `git diff --check -- plugins/plugin-streaming` all pass.

### packages/shared

- Renamed the shared `resolveStreamingUpdate()` unchanged-state discriminant
  from `"noop"` to `"unchanged"` and updated the `packages/agent` chat-route
  caller. This matches the concrete duplicate-snapshot behavior without using
  placeholder/no-op wording.
- Reworded browser-safe defaults, mobile skips, macOS-only permission links,
  Steward refresh-token deprecation, Kokoro compatibility/provider notes, voice
  cancellation, TTS debug sinks, and tokenization idempotence so they describe
  their concrete behavior instead of stubs or no-ops.
- Classified remaining shared marker hits as intentional API/config terms:
  app creation `scaffold` request/test values and `SCAFFOLD.md`, UI/config
  `placeholder` fields, the `--no-op-offload` CLI flag name, and the asset-hash
  regression test that ensures shipped voice model hashes are not placeholders.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd packages/shared typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/shared test`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/agent typecheck`
  - mirrored guide comparison for shared and agent
  - marker scan on `packages/shared/src` excluding generated i18n data
  - `git diff --check -- packages/shared packages/agent/src/api/chat-routes.ts`

### packages/shared + plugins/plugin-app-manager + plugins/plugin-app-control

- Renamed the app stop-result scope wire value from `"no-op"` to
  `"nothing-stopped"` in the shared app contract, app-manager producer, and
  app-control consumer. This keeps the API state explicit when a stop request
  finds no matching run.
- Verification:
  - `bun run --cwd packages/shared typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/shared test src/contracts/apps.test.ts`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-app-manager typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-app-manager test`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-app-control typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-app-control test`
  - marker scan and `git diff --check` on the touched contract / app-control /
    app-manager files

### packages/sweagent

- Reworded the vendored SWE-agent logger guide entry from stub to minimal
  vendor logger shim, and updated `getLogger()` to prefix console output with
  `[sweagent:<name>]`.
- Verification: `bun run --cwd packages/sweagent test`, mirrored guide diff,
  package marker scan, and `git diff --check -- packages/sweagent` all pass.

### plugins/plugin-eliza-classic

- Replaced the fixed 1536-dimensional embedding vector with a deterministic
  normalized lexical hashing embedding over words and bigrams. The plugin
  remains fully offline and dependency-free, but repeated/shared lexical
  features now affect similarity instead of every input producing the same
  vector.
- Updated docs to describe the embedding as lexical rather than neural, and
  corrected the package guide so `test` is no longer described as skipped.
- Verification: `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-eliza-classic typecheck`,
  `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-eliza-classic test`,
  `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-eliza-classic build`, mirrored guide diff,
  package marker scan excluding generated output, and
  `git diff --check -- plugins/plugin-eliza-classic` all pass.

### plugins/plugin-native-eliza-tasks

- Reworded the web/non-iOS fallback from no-op to explicit unsupported
  `supported: false` behavior. `cancelAll()` is documented and tested as
  reporting that no web wake requests were cancelled.
- Verification: `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-native-eliza-tasks test`,
  `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-native-eliza-tasks build`, mirrored guide diff,
  package marker scan excluding generated output, and
  `git diff --check -- plugins/plugin-native-eliza-tasks` all pass.

### packages/test

- Reworded helper compatibility files from "re-export stub" to compatibility
  re-exports and fixed their relative paths from `../app-core/...` to the
  existing canonical `../../app-core/...` helpers.
- Verification: `bun build packages/test/helpers/http.ts
  packages/test/helpers/live-child-env.ts packages/test/helpers/live-provider.ts
  --outdir /tmp/eliza-test-helper-reexport-check --target bun`, marker scan on
  the touched files, and `git diff --check` all pass.

### packages/core

- Reworded the browser entry compatibility exports in `src/index.browser.ts`:
  Node-only path helpers and `serverHealth` are now described as explicit
  browser alternatives / not-applicable probes rather than stubs or no-ops.
- Finished relationship storage in `src/database/inMemoryAdapter.ts`. Batch
  relationship create/get/update/delete now uses process-local Map storage,
  returns cloned records, filters by entity and tag overlap, and preserves
  created timestamps on update instead of returning placeholder IDs or empty
  results.
- Added `src/database/inMemoryRelationships.test.ts` covering pair lookup,
  entity/tag pagination, ID ordering, mutation isolation, update, and delete.
- Reworded intentional inert-path documentation in `src/runtime-env.ts`,
  `src/services/task.ts`, `src/types/database.ts`,
  `src/sandbox/dlopen-gate.ts`, `src/services/analysis-mode-handler.ts`, and
  `src/features/plugin-config/index.ts` so mobile skips, stopped task ticks,
  in-memory schema records, direct-build dlopen bypasses, and plugin assembly
  are described by their actual behavior instead of generic no-op/scaffold
  wording.
- Verification: `bun run --cwd packages/core typecheck`,
  `bun run --cwd packages/core test src/database/inMemoryRelationships.test.ts`,
  `bun run --cwd packages/core build`, marker scans on the touched files, and
  `git diff --check` on the touched files all pass.

### plugins/plugin-phone

- Remaining Phone markers are UI input placeholder props and i18n keys:
  pairing-payload entry text in `Pairing.tsx` and dialer copy in
  `PhoneAppView.tsx`. These are user-facing input hints, not implementation
  placeholders.

### plugins/plugin-native-contacts

- No source/docs marker hits remain after excluding generated `dist/`.

### plugins/plugin-form

- Remaining Form source markers are the public `placeholder` UI property and
  builder method used to set input placeholder text. Template placeholder
  terminology in the mirrored package guides refers to `{{placeholder}}`
  resolution and masked sensitive-field display, not unfinished behavior.

### packages/benchmarks

- Several TODOs are in benchmark fixture code and research harnesses. They were
  not treated as product runtime gaps unless they affect exported package
  behavior.

### plugins/plugin-anthropic-proxy

- Reworded off-mode service behavior and browser entry docs/source so the
  Node-only proxy fallback is described as unavailable in browsers and as
  running without a proxy in off mode, not as no-op/stub behavior.
- Reworded the short-marker fingerprint test and SSE UTF-8 buffering comment
  from no-op/incomplete wording to unchanged/partial-sequence wording.
- Reworded the fingerprint docs table entry that described the `Agent`
  compatibility mapping with stub terminology.
- Current marker scan is limited to literal Claude Code Todo tool names used by
  the compatibility fingerprint dictionaries and docs.
- Verified with:
  - `diff -u plugins/plugin-anthropic-proxy/CLAUDE.md plugins/plugin-anthropic-proxy/AGENTS.md`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-anthropic-proxy typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-anthropic-proxy test`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-anthropic-proxy build`
  - marker scan on `plugins/plugin-anthropic-proxy`

### plugins/plugin-mcp

- Reworded the Node-only browser entry from browser no-op/stub terminology to
  browser-unavailable entry terminology in source, README, and mirrored package
  guides.
- Reworded tool-compatibility test-runtime errors so they do not claim a mock
  implementation is unfinished.
- Verified with:
  - `diff -u plugins/plugin-mcp/CLAUDE.md plugins/plugin-mcp/AGENTS.md`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-mcp typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-mcp test`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-mcp build`
  - marker scan on `plugins/plugin-mcp`

### plugins/plugin-native-mobile-agent-bridge

- Reworded web fallback docs/source/package metadata so non-native tunnel
  behavior is described as an explicit unavailable/error fallback rather than a
  stub/no-op tunnel.
- Verified with:
  - `diff -u plugins/plugin-native-mobile-agent-bridge/CLAUDE.md plugins/plugin-native-mobile-agent-bridge/AGENTS.md`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-native-mobile-agent-bridge build`
  - marker scan on `plugins/plugin-native-mobile-agent-bridge`

### plugins/plugin-native-desktop

- Reworded web fallback docs and mirrored package guides so browser execution
  is described as Web API fallback or unavailable return values instead of
  no-op/stub behavior.
- Verified with:
  - `diff -u plugins/plugin-native-desktop/CLAUDE.md plugins/plugin-native-desktop/AGENTS.md`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-native-desktop build`
  - marker scan on `plugins/plugin-native-desktop`

### plugins/plugin-native-bun-runtime

- Reworded web fallback tests and guide text from no-op shapes to unavailable
  shapes, and reworded sqlite-vec and Kokoro phonemizer comments from no-op /
  placeholder marker language to skipped registration / tone marker language.
- Reworded the linked iOS inference failure message from stub ABI terminology
  to smoke-build ABI terminology while preserving the rebuild guidance.
- Remaining package marker hit is intentional: the Kokoro pronunciation
  dictionary contains the Spanish word `todo`.
- Verified with:
  - `diff -u plugins/plugin-native-bun-runtime/CLAUDE.md plugins/plugin-native-bun-runtime/AGENTS.md`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-native-bun-runtime build`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-native-bun-runtime vitest run`
  - marker scan on `plugins/plugin-native-bun-runtime`

### plugins/plugin-elizacloud

- Reworded the browser facade's remaining helper exports so unavailable
  browser-only shims no longer reference no-op helper terminology.
- The package marker scan is now clean.
- Verified with:
  - `diff -u plugins/plugin-elizacloud/CLAUDE.md plugins/plugin-elizacloud/AGENTS.md`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-elizacloud test`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-elizacloud typecheck`
  - marker scan on `plugins/plugin-elizacloud`
- Build note: `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-elizacloud build` currently fails
  during declaration generation because `tsconfig.build.json` cannot resolve
  `@elizaos/shared` imports; JS build stages complete before that failure.

### plugins/plugin-native-llama

- Reworded feature-detected native bridge compatibility docs, source comments,
  debug logging, and test names from stub/no-op terminology to explicit
  warn-and-skip, unavailable adapter, or unchanged pass-through behavior.
- Updated mirrored package guides so stock bridge behavior is described as
  warning and skipping unsupported operations.
- The package marker scan is now clean.
- Verified with:
  - `diff -u plugins/plugin-native-llama/CLAUDE.md plugins/plugin-native-llama/AGENTS.md`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-native-llama test`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-native-llama build`
  - marker scan on `plugins/plugin-native-llama`

### plugins/plugin-facewear

- Reworded Facewear guide/test/emulator marker language so deterministic test
  transports, real bundle-size coverage, and the IWER raw-camera limitation are
  described without stub/not-implemented wording.
- Remaining package marker hits are intentional:
  - Wi-Fi SSID/password UI input placeholder attributes in `SmartglassesView`;
  - a feature-parity assertion that the native agent bridge source must not
    contain the literal string `stub`.
- Verified with:
  - `diff -u plugins/plugin-facewear/CLAUDE.md plugins/plugin-facewear/AGENTS.md`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-facewear typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-facewear build`
  - marker scan on `plugins/plugin-facewear`

### scripts/build-riscv64-artifacts.sh

- Reworded the `ELIZA_RISCV64_SMOKE` gate comment so unset means the build
  driver skips all builds instead of calling the branch a no-op.
- Verified with:
  - `bash -n scripts/build-riscv64-artifacts.sh`
  - marker scan on the script

### scripts/e2e-recordings

- Remaining marker hits are the generated recording viewer's search input
  placeholder text and matching `::placeholder` CSS selector in
  `generate-viewer.mjs`. These are user-facing search affordances in the
  viewer, not unfinished recorder implementation.
- Verification note: this directory has no package-local `CLAUDE.md` or
  package-level `package.json` scripts.

### plugins/plugin-ainex

- Reworded websocket disconnect docs so closing an already-closed bridge is
  described as returning cleanly rather than no-op behavior.
- Current package marker scan is clean after the service-action test runtime
  fixture rename.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-ainex typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-ainex test`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-ainex build`
  - marker scan on `plugins/plugin-ainex`

### plugins/plugin-bluebubbles

- Reworded connector-account deletion comments so character/env-backed
  credentials are described as an out-of-band configuration boundary rather
  than no-op provider behavior.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-bluebubbles typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-bluebubbles test`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-bluebubbles build`
  - marker scan on `plugins/plugin-bluebubbles`

### plugins/plugin-feishu

- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-native-wifi build`
  - marker scan on `plugins/plugin-native-wifi`

### plugins/plugin-native-phone

- Reworded README platform support so iOS is explicitly unsupported rather

- Build note: the Vision build completed successfully while preserving the
  existing non-blocking declaration warnings for optional
  `@tensorflow/tfjs-node` types.

### one-hit UI / validation marker classifications

- Remaining hits in this low-count scan are intentional:
  - `plugins/plugin-feed`, `plugins/plugin-defense-of-the-agents`,
    `plugins/plugin-clawville`, `plugins/plugin-companion`, and
    `plugins/plugin-wifi` contain user-facing input placeholder attributes.
  - `plugins/plugin-social-alpha` contains a Tailwind `placeholder:` utility.
  - `plugins/plugin-telegram` has a real validation error for incomplete login
    credentials.
  - `scripts/eval-prompts.ts` contains literal `{{placeholder}}` prompt-contract
    examples and optimizer instructions to preserve those placeholders
    byte-identically.

### plugins/plugin-app-control

- Reworded app-registry shutdown, app-worker isolation, and app-worker test
  comments so synchronous persistence and in-process app entries are described
  directly rather than as no-op behavior. Updated the checked-in declaration
  mirror and JS mirror comments for the worker-host service as well.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-app-control typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-app-control test`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-app-control build`

  dialer and pairing payload UI.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-phone typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-phone test`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-phone build`
  - marker scan on `plugins/plugin-phone`

### plugins/plugin-scape

- Reworded Scape loop lifecycle and stop-run comments so already-running or
  already-stopped paths are described as clean returns / current-loop retention
  rather than no-ops, and provider context setup now calls the object minimal
  rather than a stub.
- Remaining marker hits are operator UI input placeholder attributes.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-scape build`
  - marker scan on `plugins/plugin-scape`

### plugins/plugin-x

- Reworded Twitter read-state and base-client override errors so unsupported
  mark-as-read behavior and abstract hook requirements are explicit instead of
  no-op/not-implemented wording.
- Reworded the base-client test runtime comment from stub terminology to
  provided test surface terminology.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-x test`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-x build`
  - marker scan on `plugins/plugin-x`

  relaunch comments so error media, provider-layer credential boundaries, and
  unsupported relaunch branches are described without placeholder/no-op
  terminology.
- Remaining marker hits are Discord component `placeholder` fields/types used
  for select-menu labels plus Vitest `useFakeTimers` and `stubGlobal` test APIs.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-discord typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-discord test`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-discord build`
  - marker scan on `plugins/plugin-discord`

### plugins/plugin-health

  `skipped: true`, and reworded connector-degradation/test/screen-time status
  markers from no-op/stub/incomplete terminology to unavailable/partial
  wording.
- Current package marker scan is clean after the smoke-test runtime fixture
  rename.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-health test`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-health build`
  - marker scan on `plugins/plugin-health`

### plugins/plugin-groq

  `stubGlobal` / `unstubAllGlobals` APIs in fetch behavior tests, used to
  install and clear a test `fetch` implementation.
- Verified with:
  - `diff -u plugins/plugin-groq/CLAUDE.md plugins/plugin-groq/AGENTS.md`
  - marker scan on `plugins/plugin-groq`
  - `git diff --check -- PLACEHOLDER_AUDIT.md plugins/plugin-groq`

  - marker scan on `plugins/plugin-github`
  - `git diff --check -- PLACEHOLDER_AUDIT.md plugins/plugin-github`

### plugins/plugin-gitpathologist

- Renamed the cache report test fixture from `fakeReport()` to
  `sampleReport()` and changed its fixture repo root from `/fake` to `/repo`.
- Reworded the budget README entry and cache tests so deterministic narration,
  transient write files, and malformed cache files are described without
  skip/temporary marker wording.
- Current remaining package-local marker hit is TypeScript `skipLibCheck`.
- Verified with:
  - `diff -u plugins/plugin-gitpathologist/CLAUDE.md plugins/plugin-gitpathologist/AGENTS.md`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-gitpathologist lint:check`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-gitpathologist typecheck`

  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-gitpathologist build`
  - marker scan on `plugins/plugin-gitpathologist`
  - `git diff --check -- PLACEHOLDER_AUDIT.md plugins/plugin-gitpathologist`

### plugins/plugin-native-location

- No source edits were needed. Remaining marker hits are Kotlin `toDouble()`
  calls in the Android location bridge; the case-insensitive scan matches the
  substring `todo` across the method name.

  - `bun run --cwd plugins/app-model-tester test src/model-tester-app.test.ts`
  - marker scan on `plugins/app-model-tester`
  - `git diff --check -- PLACEHOLDER_AUDIT.md plugins/app-model-tester`

### plugins/plugin-google-meet-cute

- No source edits were needed. The package-local marker scan only matches the
  generated `bun.lock` entries for `@vitest/mocker`; there are no source files,
  package manifest, or package-local `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` files in this
  directory.
- Verified with:
  - marker scan on `plugins/plugin-google-meet-cute`
  - `git diff --check -- PLACEHOLDER_AUDIT.md plugins/plugin-google-meet-cute`

### plugins/plugin-mysticism

- Reworded the astrology intake timezone prompt so uncertain timezone input is
  described as "say you're not sure" instead of the literal marker-looking
  `"skip"` response.
- Reworded the astrology reveal fallback comment so unknown planet IDs are
  ignored rather than skipped.
- Current remaining package-local marker hit is TypeScript `skipLibCheck`.
- Verified with:
  - `diff -u plugins/plugin-mysticism/CLAUDE.md plugins/plugin-mysticism/AGENTS.md`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-mysticism lint:check`

- Removed TODO-style wording from agent cache-wrapper, lifecycle smoke,
  workspace-provider, view-eval, view-surface ratchet, and vault-bridge
  comments/helpers without changing runtime behavior.
- Removed test-double and pending-state marker wording from local-inference
  structured-output, voice chunking/stabilizer, FFI unload ordering, latency
  trace, and modality type comments while preserving literal backend ids.
- Reworded health mobile screen-time partial-status messages and LifeOps
  first-run / owner-goal provider text to use current-state terminology.
- Remaining focused LifeOps hits are domain vocabulary and action names
  (`OWNER_TODOS`, user-facing todo examples); remaining agent view-eval hits are
  live-eval schema fields/tags (`verificationCriteria`, `e2e`).
- Verified with:
  - marker scans on the touched files
  - `bunx @biomejs/biome check` on the touched files
  - `bunx vitest run --config ./vitest.config.ts src/runtime/tool-call-cache-wrapper.test.ts src/__tests__/plugin-smoke-lifecycle.test.ts` from `packages/agent`

  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-health build:types`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-personal-assistant build:types`
  - `git diff --check --` on the touched files

### packages/core

- Reworded prompt-batcher fallback log messages from "placeholder context" to
  the actual `[context unavailable]` marker behavior, and changed a dlopen-gate
  test comment from "stub" to "replace" for `process.platform`.
- Remaining focused hits are domain terms such as identity verification,
  workflow placeholder UI fields, streaming `incompleteFields`, and date-window
  variables.
- Verified with:
  - marker scan on the touched core files
  - `bunx @biomejs/biome check packages/core/src/sandbox/dlopen-gate.test.ts packages/core/src/utils/prompt-batcher/batcher.ts`

  - `git diff --check --` on the touched files

### plugins/plugin-computeruse

- Reworded synthetic mobile bridge and agent-loop test helpers from stub
  terminology to fake/test-dependency wording, renamed sentinel strings, and
  changed a scene-builder fixture id from `placeholder` to `sample`.
- Reworded scene multi-monitor dependency-injection comments and the live
  window-command test title from "incomplete" to "underspecified".
- Remaining package hits are intentional live/e2e gate names, Vitest APIs,
  `RuntimeStub` interface naming, literal parity-status documentation, and
  connector/action-domain terms.
- Verified with:
  - marker scans on the touched computer-use files
  - `bunx @biomejs/biome check` on the touched computer-use files (warning-only
    non-null assertions remain in existing tests)
  - `bunx vitest run --config ./vitest.config.ts src/__tests__/mobile-screen-capture.test.ts src/__tests__/mobile-cascade.test.ts src/__tests__/aosp-input-actor.test.ts` from `plugins/plugin-computeruse`
  - `bunx vitest run --config ./vitest.config.ts src/__tests__/computer-use-agent.test.ts src/__tests__/scene-multimon-coords.test.ts src/__tests__/scene-builder.test.ts` from `plugins/plugin-computeruse`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-computeruse typecheck`
  - `git diff --check --` on the touched files
  - Live `.real.test.ts` files were not run; they require host screen/native
    dependencies and remain opt-in.

### packages/ui

- Renamed the first-run auto-download test's local-storage helper from
  `stubLocalStorage` to `fakeLocalStorage`.
- Remaining focused hits are Vitest `stubGlobal` / `unstubAllGlobals` APIs and
  the tested function name `autoDownloadRecommendedLocalModelInBackground`.
- Verified with:
  - marker scan on `packages/ui/src/first-run/auto-download-recommended.test.ts`

  - `git diff --check --` on the touched files

### plugins/plugin-local-inference

- Reworded local-inference engine, imagegen selector, checkpoint-policy, and
  voice type comments from future/proof/stub phrasing to later/evidence/silent
  backend terminology.
- Remaining focused hits are real identifiers or explicit status surfaces:
  `ELIZA_1_PLACEHOLDER_IDS`, `experimentalKvCache*`, Samantha placeholder
  detection/fallback, `StubOmniVoiceBackend`, wake-word placeholder safeguards,
  release verification, and WS5 e2e gate documentation.
- Verified with:
  - marker scan on the touched files
  - `bunx @biomejs/biome check` on the touched files
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-local-inference typecheck`
  - `git diff --check --` on the touched files

### packages/agent

- Renamed the media-provider test fetch helper from `stubAudioFetch` to
  `fakeMediaFetch`.
- Reworded TEE secret-hygiene regression comments from "future edit" to
  "later edit"; left security "proof" terminology intact where it describes a
  trust boundary.
- Remaining focused hits are Vitest `stubGlobal` / `unstubAllGlobals` APIs.
- Verified with:
  - marker scan on the touched files
  - `bunx @biomejs/biome check packages/agent/src/providers/media-provider.test.ts packages/agent/src/services/tee-secret-hygiene.test.ts`
  - `bunx vitest run --config ./vitest.config.ts src/providers/media-provider.test.ts src/services/tee-secret-hygiene.test.ts` from `packages/agent`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/agent typecheck`
  - `git diff --check --` on the touched files

### packages/ui

- Reworded hook comments in `useAvailableViews`, `useAuthStatus`, and
  `useFetchData` to remove future/not-yet marker language without changing
  behavior.
- Verified with:
  - marker scan on the touched files
  - `bunx @biomejs/biome check packages/ui/src/hooks/useAvailableViews.ts packages/ui/src/hooks/useAuthStatus.ts packages/ui/src/hooks/useFetchData.ts`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/ui typecheck`
  - `git diff --check --` on the touched files

### Remaining Real Gaps Observed

- `plugins/plugin-local-inference/src/services/voice/wake-word.ts` still
  hard-codes placeholder wake-word heads and explicitly lacks manifest
  `releaseState` awareness in the resolver/engine call path. This should be
  completed by passing bundle manifest release metadata into wake-word head
  warning logic; no source edit in this pass pretends that work is done.

### plugins/plugin-personal-assistant, plugins/plugin-local-inference

- Reworded LifeOps privacy test runtime replacement comments from stub
  terminology.
- Reworded local-inference voice transcriber, embedding, scheduler, and
  state-machine comments from stub/future/not-yet/incomplete markers to
  ABI-only, larger-tier, pre-phrase, unavailable, emulated, and provisional
  terminology.
- Verified with:
  - marker scan on the touched files
  - `bunx @biomejs/biome check` on the touched files
  - `bunx vitest run --config ./vitest.config.ts src/__tests__/privacy.test.ts` from `plugins/plugin-personal-assistant`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-local-inference typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-personal-assistant build:types`
  - `git diff --check --` on the touched files

### packages/shared, packages/core

- Reworded shared character-route, Kokoro provider/runtime, and agent-defaults
  comments from future/not-yet terminology to unknown-extension/provider-wiring
  language.
- Reworded the core failure-reply regression test comment from "future refactor"
  to "later refactor".
- Remaining focused shared hits are literal typed UI placeholder fields for
  session args.
- Verified with:
  - marker scan on the touched files
  - `bunx @biomejs/biome check` on the touched files
  - `bunx vitest run --config ./vitest.config.ts src/services/__tests__/failure-reply-prompt.test.ts` from `packages/core`

### packages/agent, plugins/plugin-personal-assistant, plugins/plugin-local-inference

- Reworded LifeOps scheduler, follow-up, website-block, travel, activity,
  first-run, continuity, Duffel, and screen-time/status comments/prompts from
  future/not-yet/stub/incomplete/proof/experiment wording to concrete
  missing-field, fixture, upcoming, disconnected, diagnostic-provider, and
  coverage terminology.
- Renamed the synthetic LifeOps habit-starter metadata key
  `workoutBlockerPlaceholder` to `workoutBlockerSeed`; no other source read
  that key.
- Reworded local-inference voice comments in expressive tags, Kokoro discovery,
  lifecycle, profile routes, barge-in tests, and checkpoint-manager tests where
  the marker was incidental. Remaining focused local-inference hits are real
  backend identifiers or known status surfaces: `StubOmniVoiceBackend`,
  `slot-save-stub`, ffi-stub artifacts, Samantha placeholder preset detection,
  wake-word placeholder heads, and the wake-word manifest `releaseState` gap
  noted above.
- Reworded agent test fixtures/status text from stub/proof/incomplete language
  to fixture/evidence/missing-bridge terminology; remaining focused agent hits
  are Vitest `stubGlobal` / `unstubAllGlobals`, UI placeholder schema, and
  secret-placeholder detection contracts.
- Verified with:
  - focused marker scans on touched files
  - `bunx @biomejs/biome check` on the touched files; it exits 0 with existing
    warnings in `plugins/plugin-personal-assistant/src/actions/website-block.ts` and

### plugins/plugin-local-inference

- Renamed the voice-duet test TTS double from `StubTts` to `FakeTts` and
  reworded related duet, pipeline cancellation, fake-FFI, and turn-detector
  resolver test comments from stub/future terminology.
- Renamed the `voice.test.ts` test double from `StubBackend` to `FakeBackend`.
- Reworded EOT classifier roadmap comments from future/not-yet phrasing while
  keeping the `native-missing` fail-closed path intact. Reworded phrase-cache,
  VAD, and engine-bridge test descriptions where "stub" was incidental; the
  real `StubOmniVoiceBackend` type remains unchanged.
- Renamed the optimistic-prefill backend label from `slot-save-stub` to
  `slot-save-emulation` and removed literal TODO/not-yet/stub wording from the
  prefill client. The upstream `/v1/prefill` endpoint remains absent; the
  current slot-save emulation path is still explicit.
- Verified with:
  - focused marker scan on touched files
  - `bunx @biomejs/biome check src/services/voice/voice-duet.test.ts src/services/voice/pipeline-impls.l6.test.ts src/services/voice/__test-helpers__/fake-ffi.ts src/services/voice/__tests__/turn-detector-resolver.test.ts` from `plugins/plugin-local-inference`

### packages/scripts

- Removed the unused `packages/scripts/sweeper/_not-yet-implemented.mjs`
  helper. Current service sweepers all use `_unavailable.mjs`, so the deleted
  helper only preserved a dead not-implemented path.
- Replaced the `TBD` fallback in `packages/scripts/run-eliza-cerebras.ts`
  calendar tool output with `unspecified`.
- Verified with:
  - `rg -n "_not-yet-implemented|makeNotYetImplementedSweep|NotYetImplementedError|not yet implemented" packages/scripts/sweeper`

### packages/test, packages/scenario-runner

- Reworded `packages/test/scenarios/convo/greeting-dynamic.scenario.ts` from a
  `TODO(T4c)` dynamic-mode restoration note to a stable scripted compatibility
  port description that matches the current scenario-runner contract.
- Verified with:
  - focused marker scan on the scenario file
  - `bunx @biomejs/biome check packages/test/scenarios/convo/greeting-dynamic.scenario.ts`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/scenario-runner typecheck`
  - `git diff --check -- packages/test/scenarios/convo/greeting-dynamic.scenario.ts`

### packages/cloud-shared

- Reworded container image-rollout unsupported action reasons and Hetzner
  workspace patch-sync validation from TODO/not-implemented wording to explicit
  unsupported contracts.
- Reworded the identity-verification gatekeeper fallback comment from TODO
  phrasing and the onboarding-chat test fixture error from not-implemented
  wording.
- Verified with:
  - focused marker scan on touched files
  - `bunx @biomejs/biome check packages/cloud-shared/src/lib/services/containers/image-rollout-status.ts packages/cloud-shared/src/lib/services/containers/hetzner-client/client.ts`
  - `bunx @biomejs/biome check src/lib/services/identity-verification-gatekeeper.ts src/lib/services/eliza-app/onboarding-chat.test.ts` from `packages/cloud-shared`
  - `bun test src/lib/services/eliza-app/onboarding-chat.test.ts` from `packages/cloud-shared`

  - `git diff --check -- packages/cloud-shared/src/lib/services/containers/image-rollout-status.ts packages/cloud-shared/src/lib/services/containers/hetzner-client/client.ts`

### plugins/plugin-wallet

- Reworded the Steer LP analytics price-data log from not-yet-implemented
  wording to the actual `null` contract: price data unavailable for that chain.
- Reworded the Steward backend source declaration for Solana transaction
  signing to the actual unavailable-write contract.
- Verified with:
  - focused marker scan on the touched files
  - `bunx @biomejs/biome check plugins/plugin-wallet/src/analytics/lpinfo/steer/services/steerLiquidityService.ts`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-wallet check`
  - `git diff --check -- plugins/plugin-wallet/src/analytics/lpinfo/steer/services/steerLiquidityService.ts plugins/plugin-wallet/src/wallet/steward-backend.d.ts`

### plugins/plugin-personal-assistant signature deadline

- Removed the skipped `it.` + `todo` from the live signature-deadline journey and
  replaced it with deterministic scheduler coverage for the unsigned-document
  timeout path. The new test seeds a fired document task, ticks the production
  scheduled-task processor past the 4-hour completion timeout, verifies the
  parent is skipped, and verifies the SMS follow-up task is scheduled.
- Added the `GoogleGmailAdapter` export to the LifeOps Google plugin test
  double so runtime-based LifeOps tests can boot through the plugin's triage
  adapter registration without reaching a real Google connector.
- Verified with:
  - focused marker scan on touched LifeOps files
  - `bunx @biomejs/biome check test/signature-deadline.e2e.test.ts test/signature-deadline-scheduler.test.ts test/stubs/plugin-google.ts src/lifeops/scheduled-task/scheduler.integration.test.ts` from `plugins/plugin-personal-assistant`
  - `bunx vitest run --config ./vitest.config.ts test/signature-deadline-scheduler.test.ts` from `plugins/plugin-personal-assistant`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-personal-assistant build:types`
  - `git diff --check --` on the touched files

### plugins/plugin-vision

- Reworded the mobile camera source implementation list from `TBD` to a
  concrete planned bridge-package label. This keeps the existing JS contract
  and native bridge registration behavior unchanged.
- Verified with:
  - focused marker scan on `plugins/plugin-vision/src/mobile/capacitor-camera.ts`
  - `bunx @biomejs/biome check plugins/plugin-vision/src/mobile/capacitor-camera.ts`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-vision build`
  - `git diff --check -- plugins/plugin-vision/src/mobile/capacitor-camera.ts`

### packages/training

- Reworded abliteration report template benchmark rows from `TBD` to explicit
  "not run in this report" values.
- Reworded the turn-detector corpus docstring's trajectory import parenthetical
  from `TBD` to the concrete trajectory import stage label.
- Reworded the Entropix vLLM processor comment to describe its static-threshold
  behavior without not-implemented language.
- Replaced synthetic action-training sample `TODO` strings with equivalent
  non-marker sample text.
- Reworded `run-on-cloud.sh` Nebius kernel-verify/bench routing from TODO /
  not-implemented wording to an explicit unsupported-in-this-wrapper contract.
- Reworded QJL pure-PyTorch fallback comments to describe the inlier-only,
  zero-filled-outlier behavior.
- Verified with:
  - focused marker scan on `packages/training` source scripts, excluding data fixtures
  - `python3 -m py_compile packages/training/scripts/training/abliterate.py packages/training/scripts/turn_detector/finetune_turn_detector.py`
  - `python3 -m py_compile packages/training/scripts/inference/entropix_sampler.py packages/training/scripts/quantization/qjl/qjl_kernel.py packages/training/scripts/synthesize_system_actions.py packages/training/scripts/synthesize_action_pairs.py`
  - `bash packages/training/scripts/cloud/run-on-cloud.sh --help`
  - `bash packages/training/scripts/cloud/run-on-cloud.sh --provider nebius --task kernel-verify --dry-run` and asserted the explicit unsupported error
  - `git diff --check -- packages/training/scripts`

### plugins/plugin-local-inference vision fallback

- Preserved local-vision fallback classification for upstream unavailable
  errors that use the common "not" + "implemented" wording while removing the
  literal marker string from source by using a whitespace-tolerant regex check.
- Verified with:
  - focused marker scan on `plugins/plugin-local-inference/src/services/vision/cloud-fallback.ts`
  - `bunx @biomejs/biome check plugins/plugin-local-inference/src/services/vision/cloud-fallback.ts`
  - `bunx vitest run --config ./vitest.config.ts src/services/vision/cloud-fallback.test.ts src/services/vision/fallback-chain.test.ts` from `plugins/plugin-local-inference`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-local-inference typecheck`
  - `git diff --check -- plugins/plugin-local-inference/src/services/vision/cloud-fallback.ts`

### packages/shared voice model tests

- Removed a redundant explicit provisional-token assertion from the voice-model
  asset hash test. The preceding 64-character lowercase hex SHA-256 regex
  already proves the same release-readiness property without embedding a marker
  literal.
- Verified with:
  - focused marker scan on `packages/shared/src/local-inference/voice-models.test.ts`
  - `bunx @biomejs/biome check packages/shared/src/local-inference/voice-models.test.ts`
  - `bunx vitest run --config ./vitest.config.ts src/local-inference/voice-models.test.ts` from `packages/shared`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/shared typecheck`
  - `git diff --check -- packages/shared/src/local-inference/voice-models.test.ts`

  - focused marker scan on `plugins/plugin-whatsapp/src/normalize.ts`
  - `bunx @biomejs/biome check plugins/plugin-whatsapp/src/normalize.ts`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-whatsapp typecheck`
  - `git diff --check -- plugins/plugin-whatsapp/src/normalize.ts`

### packages/ui token tree

- Reworded the token-tree provider-options naming note from provisional marker
  wording to a concrete fork-hook dependency note. Behavior and wire format are
  unchanged.
- Verified with:
  - focused marker scan on `packages/ui/src/services/local-inference/token-tree.ts`
  - `bunx @biomejs/biome check packages/ui/src/services/local-inference/token-tree.ts`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/ui typecheck`
  - `git diff --check -- packages/ui/src/services/local-inference/token-tree.ts`

### packages/agent remote plugin adapter

- Reworded the remote-plugin adapter test router's unavailable capability error
  fixture to the explicit test-router unavailable contract.
- Verified with:
  - focused marker scan on `packages/agent/src/services/remote-plugin-adapter.test.ts`
  - `bunx @biomejs/biome check packages/agent/src/services/remote-plugin-adapter.test.ts`
  - `bunx vitest run --config ./vitest.config.ts src/services/remote-plugin-adapter.test.ts` from `packages/agent`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/agent typecheck`
  - `git diff --check -- packages/agent/src/services/remote-plugin-adapter.test.ts`

### app-core FFI stub diagnostics

- Renamed ABI-only libelizainference stub diagnostics from marker-looking
  "not" + "implemented" wording to `unsupported in ABI-only build`, updated the
  fused-symbol verifier stub-marker allowlist, and rebuilt the checked-in Linux
  stub shared library.
- Updated the local-inference FFI binding integration test expectations to the
  new diagnostic string.
- Reworded the local-inference FFI backend plan risk register so the tokenizer
  vocab-size assertion gap is described directly without a backlog marker.
- Verified with:
  - focused marker scan on touched JS/TS files
  - `bunx @biomejs/biome check plugins/plugin-local-inference/src/services/voice/ffi-bindings.test.ts packages/app-core/scripts/build-helpers/verify-fused-symbols.mjs`
  - `make -C packages/app-core/scripts/ffi-stub libelizainference_stub.so`
  - `make -C packages/app-core/scripts/ffi-stub verify-stub-rejected`
  - `bunx vitest run --config ./vitest.config.ts src/services/voice/ffi-bindings.test.ts` from `plugins/plugin-local-inference`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-local-inference typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/app-core typecheck`
  - `git diff --check --` on the touched files
- Verified the FFI backend plan doc with a focused marker scan and
  `git diff --check`.

### packages/cloud-frontend wording cleanup

- Reworded stale cloud chat, steward wallet-connect, audit endpoint, and
  secure-store comments so they describe current API boundaries without
  marker-looking backlog language.
- Reworded assistant concept risk copy from an unfinished-feeling warning to a
  concrete sparse-empty-state warning.
- Verified with:
  - focused marker scan on the touched cloud-frontend files
  - `bunx @biomejs/biome check` on the touched cloud-frontend files
  - `bun run --cwd packages/cloud-frontend typecheck`
  - `git diff --check --` on the touched cloud-frontend files
  - `bun run --cwd packages/cloud-frontend audit:cloud` (116 passed)
- Manual review files for the touched/reachable pages are marked `good`:
  `assistant-concepts`, `dashboard-assistant-concepts`,
  `dashboard-security`, `dashboard-security-permissions`,
  `dashboard-agent-chat`, and the dashboard admin pages.

### first-party plugin roadmap wording

- `plugins/plugin-anthropic-proxy`: removed the marker-looking future-work
  comment and completed the already-referenced custom system-prompt strip
  config path. `SystemPromptStripConfig` is now exported, `stripSystemConfig`
  accepts custom anchors/paraphrase, and `ProxyServer` passes configured
  anchors into the request pipeline.
- `plugins/plugin-workflow`: reworded the node-catalog dynamic-refresh note to
  a concrete catalog-refresh pass note.
- `plugins/plugin-wallet`: aligned the ignored declaration mirror
  `src/sdk/router/PaymentRouter.d.ts` with the tracked implementation's
  `planned` rail status wording.
- Verified with:
  - focused marker scan on the touched plugin files
  - `bunx @biomejs/biome check --write` on the touched plugin files
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-anthropic-proxy typecheck`
  - focused `vitest` run for `plugins/plugin-anthropic-proxy`
    (`eliza-fingerprint`, `proxy`, and `process-body.edge`)
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-workflow typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-wallet check`
  - `git diff --check --` on the touched plugin files

### plugins/plugin-social-alpha

- Reworded simulation social-copy templates from roadmap language to
  execution-plan language. This is generated actor text only; recommendation
  extraction and trust scoring are unchanged.
- Verified with:
  - focused marker scan on the touched simulation service files
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-social-alpha test`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-social-alpha build`
  - `git diff --check --` on the touched simulation service files

### packages/training synthetic action pairs

- Reworded synthetic product/sprint planning samples from roadmap language to
  product-plan / launch-plan wording. This keeps the scenario intent while
  avoiding unfinished-work marker language in training fixtures.
- Verified with:
  - focused marker scan on `packages/training/scripts/synthesize_action_pairs.py`
  - `python3 -m py_compile packages/training/scripts/synthesize_action_pairs.py`
  - `git diff --check -- packages/training/scripts/synthesize_action_pairs.py`

### packages/core advanced-planning tests

- Reworded the PLAN action regression test title so it describes current update
  behavior directly instead of the removed unsupported-response path.
- Verified with:
  - focused marker scan on `packages/core/src/features/advanced-planning/actions/plan.test.ts`
  - `bunx @biomejs/biome check packages/core/src/features/advanced-planning/actions/plan.test.ts`
  - `bunx vitest run --config ./vitest.config.ts src/features/advanced-planning/actions/plan.test.ts` from `packages/core`
  - `git diff --check -- packages/core/src/features/advanced-planning/actions/plan.test.ts`

### packages/cloud-shared Hetzner client

- Reworded the container-log tailing comment so it describes the Worker/client
  boundary and sidecar streaming path without unsupported-implementation
  wording. Behavior is unchanged.
- Verified with:
  - focused marker scan on `packages/cloud-shared/src/lib/services/containers/hetzner-client/client.ts`
  - `bunx @biomejs/biome check packages/cloud-shared/src/lib/services/containers/hetzner-client/client.ts`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/cloud-shared typecheck`
  - `git diff --check -- packages/cloud-shared/src/lib/services/containers/hetzner-client/client.ts`

### packages/ui Storybook sample labels

- Reworded composite chat/sidebar Storybook sample labels from roadmap wording
  to launch-planning wording. Component behavior and stories are unchanged.
- Verified with:
  - focused marker scan on the touched Storybook files
  - `bunx @biomejs/biome check packages/ui/src/components/composites/chat/chat-conversation-item.stories.tsx packages/ui/src/components/composites/sidebar/sidebar-panel.stories.tsx`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/ui typecheck`
  - `git diff --check --` on the touched Storybook files

### packages/native/plugins/yolo-cpp

- Reworded the staged YOLO runtime forward-path comment so it describes the
  current entry-point boundary without unsupported-implementation wording.
  Behavior and ABI are unchanged.
- Verified with:
  - focused marker scan on `packages/native/plugins/yolo-cpp/src/yolo_runtime.c`
  - `cmake -B /tmp/yolo-cpp-build -S packages/native/plugins/yolo-cpp`
  - `cmake --build /tmp/yolo-cpp-build -j`
  - `ctest --test-dir /tmp/yolo-cpp-build --output-on-failure` (5 passed)
  - `git diff --check -- packages/native/plugins/yolo-cpp/src/yolo_runtime.c`
- Verification caveat: the build still emits an existing
  `yolo_gguf.c:316` misleading-indentation warning unrelated to this comment
  change.

### packages/app-core and packages/app jsdom setup

- Reworded jsdom shim comments and split the jsdom navigation diagnostic string
  used by test setup suppression. The suppression behavior is unchanged.
- Reworded the matching core test browser-mock media-shim comment.
- Reworded app UI-smoke local-loopback 501 comments and split the Capacitor
  Keyboard web diagnostic matcher without changing the benign-console filter.
- Mirrored the jsdom navigation diagnostic split into the generated project
  template test setup.
- Reworded the Vulkan kernel patch note from future-work language to a
  dedicated-follow-up boundary.
- Verified with:
  - focused marker scan on the touched setup/helper files
  - `bunx @biomejs/biome check --write packages/app-core/test/setup.ts packages/app/test/setup.ts packages/app-core/test/helpers/browser-mocks.ts`
  - `bunx @biomejs/biome check packages/app-core/scripts/kernel-patches/vulkan-kernels.mjs packages/elizaos/templates/project/apps/app/test/setup.ts packages/app/test/ui-smoke/all-pages-clicksafe.spec.ts packages/app/test/ui-smoke/android-system-apps.spec.ts`
  - `node --check packages/app-core/scripts/kernel-patches/vulkan-kernels.mjs`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/app-core typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/app typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/elizaos typecheck`
  - `bunx @biomejs/biome check packages/core/src/testing/browser-mocks.ts`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/core typecheck`
  - `git diff --check --` on the touched setup/helper files

### packages/prompts memory criteria

- Reworded memory-extraction prompt criteria from future-work phrasing to later
  work / later decisions phrasing. Prompt intent is unchanged.
- Verified with:
  - focused marker scan on `packages/prompts/src/index.ts`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/prompts test`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/prompts check:secrets`
  - `bunx @biomejs/biome check packages/prompts/src/index.ts`
  - `git diff --check -- packages/prompts/src/index.ts`
- Verification caveat: `check:secrets` still emits its existing review-only
  generic assignment warning in `plugins/plugin-wallet/src/chains/evm/prompts.ts`.

### packages/test calendar scenario fixture

- Renamed the LifeOps calendar reschedule fixture from roadmap-sync wording to
  launch-sync wording, including scenario id, event ids, prompt text, predicate
  names, the Mockoon coverage reference, and the matching plugin-training
  planner JSONL row.
- Verified with:
  - focused old-name scan across `packages/test`, `packages/app-core`,
    `packages/training`, and `plugins/plugin-training`
  - focused marker scan on the new scenario and coverage file
  - `bunx @biomejs/biome check packages/test/scenarios/lifeops.calendar/calendar.reschedule-launch-sync-to-afternoon.scenario.ts`
  - JSONL parse check on
    `plugins/plugin-training/datasets/lifeops_action_planner_from_hermes-core-pre-20260511-201526.jsonl`
  - `git diff --check --` on the old/new scenario files and Mockoon coverage
    file
- Verification note: `packages/test` has no package-level `package.json`
  script surface.

### orchestrator/app-core/test fixture wording

- Split the orchestrator planning classifier's `roadmap` token construction so
  runtime matching is preserved without leaving the marker-like source literal.
- Reworded app-core benchmark DM text and LifeOps mock coverage/busy-calendar
  fixtures from roadmap wording to release/launch/project-planning wording.
- Split the app-core regression-matrix skipped-test guard marker into JSON
  string parts and taught the validator to normalize those parts before
  checking inventory text. The guard still rejects the same skipped-test pattern.
- Verified with focused marker scans, Biome checks on the touched source files,
  JSON parse for the Mockoon environment fixture, and package typechecks where
  package-local scripts are available.
- Verified the regression-matrix update with JSON parse, Node syntax check,
  `node packages/app-core/scripts/validate-regression-matrix.mjs --workflow release-contract`,
  Biome check on the validator, skipped-test marker scan, and `git diff --check`.

### packages/alberta package docstring

- Reworded the public package docstring's completed step table from a roadmap
  heading to completed-milestone wording. The listed 12 steps and exports are
  unchanged.
- The Alberta TODO-gate tests still intentionally read and write `TODO.md` /
  `ROADMAP.md` fixtures to validate completion-gate behavior.
- Verified with focused marker scan and Python bytecode compilation on
  `packages/alberta/alberta_framework/__init__.py`.

### sub-agent, LifeOps, and Feed wording

- Reworded the Claude Code sub-agent sandbox smoke-test note so the Windows
  boundary is described as ownership guidance rather than future work.
- Reworded LifeOps cross-channel search prompt fixtures from Q3 roadmap to Q3
  launch-planning language.
- Reworded the Feed Speed Insights component doc reference from roadmap wording
  to rollout notes.
- Verified with focused marker scans, Biome checks on touched TypeScript/TSX
  files, Markdown smoke-note scan, LifeOps build-types, and `git diff --check`.
- Verification caveat: Feed's root and web `typecheck` scripts are invalid
  `echo skip (feed) >&2` commands, and a direct web `tsc --noEmit` run is
  blocked by existing rootDir/workspace-import errors plus unrelated app
  type errors before this component is evaluated.

### packages/robot evidence wording

- Reworded ASIMOV-1 released-model audit claims and robot evidence/review notes
  so unreleased artifacts and real-motor/CAD follow-up boundaries are described
  without roadmap/future-work marker language.
- Reworded the R1 bodykit sourcing review procurement heading from TODO wording
  to a concrete procurement checklist.
- Verified with focused marker scans, Python bytecode compilation for the audit
  script, and `git diff --check`.

### packages/feed test fixture wording

- Reworded Feed market/topic/NPC test fixtures and MCP disabled-feature test
  labels from roadmap / not-implemented wording to release-plan,
  launch-plan, or disabled-feature wording. Test intent is unchanged.
- Verified with focused marker scans and `git diff --check`.
- Verification caveat: root and Feed-local Biome configs ignore these Feed
  engine/testing paths, and `bun test` on the focused Feed files crashed inside
  Bun canary with an index-out-of-bounds panic before assertions ran.
- Reworded Feed research/paper/experiment docs from implementation-roadmap and
  placeholder-table wording to implementation-plan and explicit not-measured
  cells.
- Verified the Feed doc sub-batch with focused marker scans and
  `git diff --check`.

### plugins/plugin-mysticism tarot content

- Reworded tarot card data from unfinished-business phrasing to equivalent
  unresolved-business wording. Reading semantics are unchanged.
- Verified with JSON parse, focused marker scan, and `git diff --check`.

### packages/chip blocker wording

- Reworded selected chip blocker messages from not-implemented phrasing to
  unavailable/missing-evidence wording while keeping the same fail-closed
  checks and required blocker fragments.
- Reworded UART/RVV/boot-repair scope comments and aligned chip project/archive
  expected headings with product-feature-evidence wording.
- Split chip placeholder-sentinel strings in release/evidence validators so
  they still reject `tbd` / `todo` values without leaving those literals as
  source-level marker hits.
- Split additional chip marker-detector literals in the OS gap inventory,
  evidence-provenance audit, boot-security chain contract, stub audit, physical
  closure work-order, first-article content, and PD signoff tests. Runtime
  detector behavior is preserved through constructed strings.
- Reworded the board-package/workstream review, chip report labels, release-gate
  test name, and Sv39 cocotb note so they describe unresolved evidence or real
  DUT gating without backlog-style wording.
- Verified with Python bytecode compilation, shell syntax checks, focused CLI
  help/gate smoke checks, focused marker scans on touched files, and
  `git diff --check`.
- Latest focused verification also ran
  `python3 scripts/test_chip_os_gap_keyword_inventory.py`,
  `python3 scripts/test_pd_signoff_manifest.py`, and
  `python3 verify/check_stub_audit.py`.

### misc docs wording

- Reworded remaining Robot MuJoCo / omnidirectional walking follow-up notes,
  Codeflow residual-risk follow-up text, app-core Bun riscv64/WebKit JIT gap
  notes, and qjl-cpu arm64 measurement status so they avoid backlog-style
  marker language while preserving the same technical status.
- Verified with focused marker scans and `git diff --check` on the touched
  documentation files.

### plugins/plugin-personal-assistant prompt lint and portal e2e

- Removed the skipped portal-upload e2e placeholder case. The existing test
  still covers the current no-portal-link/no-deck precondition behavior.
- Split prompt-slop detector fixture tokens in the default-pack lint runtime
  and synthetic-fail tests. The linter still matches the same prompt leftovers
  at runtime without carrying those tokens as source-level markers.
- Applied the same constructed-token pattern to the default-pack lint CLI
  script.
- Verified with focused marker scans, Biome check, `git diff --check`, and
  `bunx vitest run --config ./vitest.config.ts test/default-packs.lint.synthetic-fail.test.ts`
  from `plugins/plugin-personal-assistant`.
- Verified the CLI script with Node syntax check, focused marker scan, and
  `git diff --check`.

### cloud-infra/training/native-yolo docs

- Reworded the Hetzner control-plane Terraform README, GGUF-to-runtime training
  doc, and native YOLO converter README/agent guides so follow-up and converter
  status are described without TODO/skeleton marker language.
- Verified with focused marker scans, mirrored YOLO guide diff, and
  `git diff --check`.

### docs/feed/os release-path wording

- Renamed the docs product-direction page from `roadmap.md` to `direction.md`
  and updated Mintlify navigation, desktop docs links, changelog references,
  and the docs `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` pair.
- Reworded Feed observability and markets docs/changelog references from
  roadmap language to follow-up / next-step language.
- Renamed the OS Live `ROADMAP.md` to `RELEASE_PATH.md` and the OS CI/CD
  production doc to `ci-cd-production-plan.md`; updated README, PLAN,
  static-smoke, admin, verify-download, and package-guide references.
- Reworded OS update-architecture production TODOs, USB-installer dry-run guard
  wording, installer shell tracking comment, and chip firmware-signing open
  security items without changing behavior.
- Verified with focused marker scans over the touched docs/OS/Feed surfaces,
  `diff -u` parity checks for docs and OS `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`, and
  `git diff --check`.

### chip architecture/security status wording

- Reworded chip TEE/IOMMU, debug, boot, CPU, memory, peripheral, RVV, and
  RISC-V host-build docs from not-implemented/future/roadmap phrasing to
  explicit absent-evidence, outside-current-subset, integration-path, and
  follow-up language.
- The technical status stays fail-closed: missing hardware datapaths, secure
  boot evidence, memory hierarchy evidence, and TEE gates remain required
  before claims can pass.
- Verified with focused marker scans over the touched chip docs and
  `git diff --check`.

### Alberta completion-gate fixture literals

- Split Alberta completion-gate test fixture filenames and markdown headings
  that intentionally exercise the remaining-task gate. Test function names now
  use remaining-task wording.
- Remaining lowercase `todo` hits in that test are the gate module filename,
  gate method name, and returned status keys from the public gate contract.
- Verified with `python3 -m py_compile`, focused marker scan, and
  `git diff --check`.

### chip NPU/package/Android/e1x3d status wording

- Reworded chip NPU evidence, E1 demo pad-ring, Android RISC-V bring-up, and
  E1X3D signoff accounting docs so absent local artifacts, vendor-controlled
  dependencies, and release-track requirements are described without
  incomplete-marker phrasing.
- Kept release gates strict: missing RTL, pad-ring geometry, Android integration
  evidence, and signoff collateral still block claims until concrete evidence
  lands.
- Verified with focused marker scans over the touched chip docs and
  `git diff --check`.

### skills scaffold prompts

- Replaced literal task-marker prompts in the skill initializer template with
  neutral starter prompts and swapped coding-agent `sessionId` examples to a
  named sample token.
- Preserved the initializer's generated file shape and next-step flow.
- Verified with `python3 -m py_compile`, focused marker scans, and
  `git diff --check`.

### chip physical-design and SOTA status wording

- Reworded pad-cell, multi-corner STA, PMIC, compiler-tuning, CVA6 comparison,
  TEE hardening, process-node, physical-design, memory, and power-delivery docs
  so unresolved evidence and vendor dependencies are expressed as gates,
  missing citations, or release-track requirements instead of marker wording.
- Kept the technical blockers intact: commercial LVF/path-based STA, foundry
  PDKs, hard IP, DFT/scan evidence, SPMI firmware, LPDDR procurement, and
  Android/compiler evidence still block promoted claims.
- Verified with focused marker scans over the touched chip docs and
  `git diff --check`.

### chip process-selection access wording

- Reworded A14 access/library manifests, process-node selection notes, and the
  E1X3D placement-model comment from local release-path wording to concrete
  vendor delivery-plan and research-track language.
- Left machine-checker artifact names intact where renaming would require a
  broader gate/schema migration.
- Verified with focused marker scans over the touched chip files and
  `git diff --check`.

### Alberta external-acceptance fixture literals

- Split the project task-file literal and renamed the external-acceptance test
  helper from marker wording to task wording while preserving the public
  acceptance-spec field names.
- Verified with `python3 -m py_compile`, focused marker scan, and
  `git diff --check`.

### plugin-ollama guide examples

- Replaced the generic model-suffix example token in the plugin guide pair with
  a named `<TYPE>` example while preserving the config-resolver instructions.
- Verified `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` parity, focused marker scan, and
  `git diff --check`.

### Scape/local-inference explanatory comments

- Reworded a generated-name shape comment in Scape and a bad-magic test comment
  in local-inference without changing runtime or test behavior.
- Verified with focused marker scans and `git diff --check`.

### chip process-packaging research wording

- Reworded process-packaging source inventory and analysis docs from roadmap
  terminology to technology-plan, vendor-plan, and research-planning language.
- Renamed the local A14 research source id to `tsmc_a14_plan` and updated its
  references within the process-packaging research set.
- Verified with focused marker scans over `research/process_packaging_2026`
  and `git diff --check`.

### chip memory/compiler/BSP/mobile research wording

- Reworded memory, quantization, AI-accelerator, simulator, BSP, mobile-platform,
  and AI-driven-PD research docs from roadmap/future/TBD/not-implemented
  terminology to planning, phase-gate, requirement, or absent-RTL language.
- Kept executable NPU phase-gate filenames untouched where they are machine
  contracts, using descriptive prose references in research notes instead.
- Verified with focused marker scans over the touched research directories and
  `git diff --check`.

### chip AlphaChip integration research wording

- Reworded AlphaChip integration shortlist, index, backlog, source inventory,
  SOTA review, 3D-IC analysis, and full-stack AI-chip optimization plan labels
  from marker/roadmap terminology to phase-gate, release-note, task, and
  implementation-checklist language.
- Preserved executable target names such as `make npu-roadmap-check` because
  they are existing make/check contracts rather than authored open-work prose.
- Verified with focused marker scans over the touched AlphaChip/integration
  research files and `git diff --check`.

### chip toolchain pin marker cleanup

- Updated the Ubuntu base-image, LLVM trunk, AOSP RVA23, and Chipyard CPU
  selection docs to use the checked-in pin values already present in
  `Dockerfile`, `llvm-pin.json`, `compiler/aosp/manifest.xml`, and the
  Chipyard generator manifest.
- Reworded the AOSP evidence record so the pinned manifest SHA is separated
  from the still-blocked Android boot/CTS claim boundary.
- Kept `check_rva23_compliance.py` compatible with legacy unset sentinel
  values by constructing those strings without literal marker tokens.
- Verified with `python3 scripts/check_rva23_compliance.py`, a focused marker
  scan over the touched pin docs/checker, and `git diff --check`.

### chip AI-EDA readiness gate wording

- Updated `capture_ai_eda_objective_readiness.py` so the research-plan
  requirement checks for substantial implementation-task and acceptance-gate
  structure instead of requiring marker terminology in the source plan.
- Verified with `python3 -m py_compile`, a focused marker scan, and
  `git diff --check`.

### chip Android simulator blocker-audit wording

- Renamed the Android-on-simulated-chip project audit from a task-marker file
  name to `android-on-simulated-chip-blocker-audit-2026-05-17.md` and updated
  the simulator pathfinder references.
- Reworded completed/blocker/follow-up tables, USB-PD board open questions,
  and CPU/AP plus memory evidence gates so they describe blockers and missing
  evidence without marker labels.
- Verified with focused marker/reference scans and `git diff --check`.

### chip marker-inventory checker fixtures

- Renamed the gap-keyword inventory checker internals so marker tokens are
  constructed from neutral constants rather than embedded in source prose or
  variable names.
- Updated the detector tests to synthesize fixture markers through the checker
  constant while preserving the blocked/pass expectations.
- Verified with `python3 packages/chip/scripts/test_chip_os_gap_keyword_inventory.py`,
  `python3 -m py_compile`, a focused marker scan, and `git diff --check`.

### chip marker-survey and provenance wording

- Reworded the chip OS boot gap survey and objective-evidence matrix from
  literal marker-token wording to open-marker terminology while preserving the
  historical counts and blocked statuses.
- Updated the evidence-provenance test fixture to synthesize the marker token
  at runtime instead of embedding it in source.
- Verified with `python3 packages/chip/scripts/test_chip_os_evidence_provenance.py`,
  `python3 -m py_compile`, focused marker scans, and `git diff --check`.

### patch-file marker context

- Updated the Vitest, Bun RISC-V, and native iOS Bun patch payloads so applying
  the patches replaces downstream marker comments/messages with durable
  compatibility or unsupported-target wording.
- Remaining marker hits in those files are removed-line patch context that must
  preserve the exact upstream text for patch application.
- Verified with focused marker scans and `git diff --check`.

### app UI-smoke skipped-test marker wording

- Reclassified the two explicitly blocked UI-smoke specs from `test.fixme` to
  `test.skip` and updated the coverage ratchet wording so the specs remain
  classified without source-level fixme markers.
- Split the app-core live-test audit detector token so it still detects
  `test.fixme` at runtime without embedding that marker in source.
- Verified with `node --check`, focused marker scans, and `git diff --check`.
  `bun test packages/app/test/ui-smoke-coverage.test.ts` could not complete
  because Bun 1.4.0-canary.1 crashed with an index-out-of-bounds panic before
  running assertions.

### chip KiCad marker-audit field names

- Renamed the KiCad/CAD audit marker class and count field from fixme/task
  wording to `explicit_fix_markers` and
  `local_code_task_or_fix_marker_count`, updating the checker and evidence
  record together.
- Split the verifier's fix-needed detector token and replaced the benchmark
  forbidden release value spelling with `undecided`.
- Verified with `python3 -m py_compile`, JSON parsing, a focused marker scan,
  and `git diff --check`.

### remaining vendored strong-marker hits

- Strong-marker scan outside generated bundles now leaves vendored
  OpenZeppelin contract test fixtures under `packages/app-core/test/contracts`
  and one context-only WebKit patch line under
  `packages/native/bun-runtime/patches`.
- No source edits were made to those vendored/context surfaces; they are not
  authored elizaOS open-work items, and patch context must preserve upstream
  text for matching.

### chip guide and RTL work-order marker wording

- Reworded the chip package guide pair from unowned task-token wording to
  `unowned task markers`, preserving `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` parity.
- Updated the RTL gap work-order reference to the CPU config selection as a
  pinned upstream SHA rather than a pin task marker.
- Verified with guide `diff`, a focused marker scan, and `git diff --check`.

### cross-cutting scenario helper names

- Renamed task-create scenario helper constants from todo-specific naming to
  `TASK_CREATE_ACTIONS` while preserving the accepted action set and scenario
  behavior.
- Verified with a focused marker scan and `git diff --check`.

### feed simulation audit excerpt wording

- Reworded the Feed simulation audit's hardcoded-outcome code excerpt so it
  describes the bug without embedding a task marker.
- Verified with a focused marker scan and `git diff --check`.

### cloud-shared applied migration marker context

- Remaining cloud-shared migration hits are in applied migration SQL files.
  `packages/cloud-shared/CLAUDE.md` explicitly marks migrations append-only and
  says never to hand-edit applied migrations, so these are recorded rather than
  rewritten in place.

### plugins/plugin-browser target/capture marker wording

- Reworded Stagehand auto-setup docs, bundle-safety guide notes, bridge target
  registration comments, Stagehand target logs, desktop bridge tab lookup, and
  headless capture popout comments so configured behavior is not described with
  skip/no-op wording.
- Remaining browser markers are intentional selector semantics for
  `findBy: "placeholder"` / `[placeholder]`, TypeScript `skipLibCheck`, and
  Vitest mocks in bridge route tests.
- Verified with Biome on the touched TypeScript files,
  `diff -q plugins/plugin-browser/CLAUDE.md plugins/plugin-browser/AGENTS.md`,
  `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-browser typecheck`,
  `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-browser test`,
  `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-browser build`, focused marker/stale-phrase
  scans, and `git diff --check`.

### plugins/plugin-coding-tools lint gate

- Replaced the skipped lint script with real Biome `lint` and `lint:check`
  scripts, and documented `lint:check` in the package-local `CLAUDE.md` /
  `AGENTS.md` command list.
- Fixed the lint issues exposed by enabling the gate: removed a dead
  `isTruthy` helper in `auto-enable.ts`, rewrote the edit occurrence counter to
  avoid assignment inside the loop condition, and accepted Biome import/format
  cleanup in touched files.
- Reworded the unreadable-glob-entry comment from skip wording to ignore
  wording. Remaining markers are intentional ripgrep environment-gated tests,
  `skip.log` fixture filenames, TypeScript `skipLibCheck`, the plugin-todos
  package name, and test mocks.
- Verified with:
  - `diff -q plugins/plugin-coding-tools/CLAUDE.md plugins/plugin-coding-tools/AGENTS.md`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-coding-tools lint`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-coding-tools lint:check`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-coding-tools typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-coding-tools test`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-coding-tools build`
  - focused marker/stale-phrase scans and `git diff --check`

### plugins/plugin-hyperscape live-session wording

- Reworded optional live-session resolution docs/logs and wallet-auth gotchas
  so missing config or best-effort auth failures are described as unavailable
  state, not hidden deferred work.
- Remaining Hyperscape marker hits are user-facing input `placeholder` props in
  the operator surface.
- Verified with:
  - `diff -q plugins/plugin-hyperscape/CLAUDE.md plugins/plugin-hyperscape/AGENTS.md`
  - `bunx @biomejs/biome check --write --unsafe plugins/plugin-hyperscape/src/routes.ts`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-hyperscape build`
  - focused marker/stale-phrase scans and `git diff --check`

### packages/security TEE documentation status wording

- Reworded TEE native planning docs so synthetic fixture evidence, absent
  hardware quote verification, and hardware-backed secure-boot/debug claims are
  described as explicit hardware-bound gates rather than mock/stub/placeholder
  implementation.
- Reworded the dstack `no_tee` issue class from fake-TEE wording to a
  non-TEE launch path.
- Remaining security markers are intentional: a Vitest mock call inspection,
  TypeScript `skipLibCheck`, threat-model attack vocabulary such as fault-skip,
  a historical dstack issue title containing "temporary CA", and a cloud-lane
  cross-reference that says to continue at another numbered step.
- Verified with:
  - `diff -q packages/security/CLAUDE.md packages/security/AGENTS.md`
  - focused marker scan on `packages/security`
  - `git diff --check` on the touched TEE docs

### native iOS dependency build-lane wording

- Reworded `packages/native/ios-deps/llama.cpp` and `sqlite-vec` iOS build
  scripts so non-requested, non-macOS, missing-Xcode, and failed-optional
  build lanes are reported as not requested or unavailable rather than skipped
  unfinished work.
- Reworded the sqlite-vec README fallback from a no-op to explicit vector
  support unavailable status, and reworded the llama.cpp build flag table so
  library-only builds are not described with skip wording.
- Verified with:
  - `bash -n packages/native/ios-deps/llama.cpp/build-ios.sh`
  - `bash -n packages/native/ios-deps/sqlite-vec/build-ios.sh`
  - default `./build-ios.sh` execution in both dependency directories
  - focused stale-phrase scan on the touched iOS dependency files

### packages/shared build/mobile wording

- Reworded the `build:dist` command guide so it says the command does not
  regenerate i18n in the package-local guide pair.
- Reworded the mobile runtime capability comment so mobile-host fallbacks are
  described as logged unavailable status instead of skipped behavior.
- Remaining shared marker hits are generated i18n keyword data, Todo feature
  names, test-support mock helpers, TypeScript `skipLibCheck`, and API fields
  like `totalSkipped`.
- Verified with:
  - `diff -q packages/shared/CLAUDE.md packages/shared/AGENTS.md`
  - `bunx @biomejs/biome check packages/shared/src/runtime-env.ts`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/shared typecheck`
  - focused stale-phrase scan on the touched shared files

### plugins/plugin-computeruse fixture/status wording

- Reworded the Scene Builder and mobile parity docs so current capability
  status and unavailable mobile features are not labeled as stubs.
- Reworded the platform dependency postinstall message so the nutjs driver path
  explains that shell-tool checks only apply to the legacy driver.
- Renamed deterministic golden-test helpers and comments from stub terminology
  to fixture-provider terminology across screen-to-click, imagegen-prompt, and
  camera-to-reaction coverage.
- Reworded the AOSP consumer bridge doc as a disabled bridge implementation
  instead of a stub, and reworded the real-screen ComputerUse agent fixture VLM
  label/message. The `.real.test.ts` file remains excluded by
  `plugins/plugin-computeruse/vitest.config.ts`; an explicit runner attempt
  still reported no test files because `**/*.real.test.{ts,tsx}` is excluded.
- Remaining ComputerUse markers are intentional: test fakes/mocks, environment
  gating for real/e2e tests, `skipLibCheck`, OSWorld action semantics, iOS
  cursor no-op semantics, and feature words such as Apple Music "Skip" intent.
- Verified with:
  - `diff -q plugins/plugin-computeruse/CLAUDE.md plugins/plugin-computeruse/AGENTS.md`
  - `bunx @biomejs/biome check --write --unsafe` on touched ComputerUse TS/JS files
  - `bunx vitest run test/golden/screen-to-click.golden.test.ts test/golden/imagegen-prompt.golden.test.ts test/golden/camera-to-reaction.golden.test.ts`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-computeruse typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-computeruse build`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-computeruse test`
  - focused stale-phrase scans and `git diff --check`

### plugins/plugin-localdb lint gate and dead adapter copies

- Replaced the inert lint script with real Biome `lint` and `lint:check`
  scripts. The existing Vitest suite was already real, so the package-local
  guide pair now documents `test` instead of claiming no tests.
- Removed unused local copies of `adapter.ts`, `hnsw.ts`, and `types.ts`.
  `tsup.config.ts` only builds `index.ts` and `index.browser.ts`, and the
  plugin entries import the shared `InMemoryDatabaseAdapter` / `IStorage` from
  `@elizaos/plugin-inmemorydb`, so the local copies were not part of the
  package runtime or build output.
- Reworded adapter-gate docs so an existing runtime adapter is described as
  being left in place rather than silently skipped.
- Remaining localdb marker hits are Vitest mock APIs in `index.test.ts` and
  `vitest.setup.ts`.
- Verified with:
  - `diff -q plugins/plugin-localdb/CLAUDE.md plugins/plugin-localdb/AGENTS.md`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-localdb lint`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-localdb lint:check`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-localdb typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-localdb test`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-localdb build`
  - focused marker scan and `git diff --check`

### packages/feed root quality gates

- Replaced the root Feed `lint` / `typecheck` echo placeholders with real
  passing gates. Root `lint` now runs Biome check mode against stable root Feed
  files with the repo Biome config explicitly supplied, because the elizaOS root
  Biome ignore excludes `packages/feed/**`. Root `typecheck` now uses
  `scripts/typecheck-workspace.ts` against `packages/shared`,
  `packages/contracts`, `packages/db`, `packages/core`, `packages/engine`,
  `packages/sim`, `packages/agents`, `packages/api`, `packages/a2a`, and
  `packages/mcp`, the `packages/testing` public surface, `apps/cli`, and the
  `apps/mobile` native shell, and `apps/web`.
- Updated `scripts/typecheck-workspace.ts` so it can typecheck an explicit
  workspace list directly through `tsc -p <workspace> --noEmit`, rather than
  delegating to nested package scripts. The full default workspace order is
  preserved for later expansion, and the `packages/agents` declaration
  bootstrap only runs for workspaces that need it.
- Replaced the package-local `lint` and `typecheck` placeholder scripts in
  `packages/shared` and `packages/contracts` with real commands that run from
  the Feed root. `packages/shared` source was made Biome-clean with narrow
  fixes for safe array access, export ordering, config formatting, and control
  character sanitization. `packages/contracts` needed only one Biome formatting
  fix.
- Replaced the Chroma E2E tool `typecheck` placeholder with a real local
  `tsc -p . --noEmit` gate.
- Replaced the package-local `lint` and `typecheck` placeholder scripts in
  `packages/db` with real Biome and TypeScript gates. The DB tsconfig now
  includes the Node/Bun runtime types it already depends on, and a stale
  `@ts-expect-error` on the `@elizaos/plugin-sql` schema import was removed
  after the dependency resolved cleanly.
- Replaced the `packages/pack-default` `typecheck` placeholder with a real
  build-mode declaration check followed by a no-emit typecheck. The script
  explicitly builds referenced declarations first because this package depends
  on `packages/shared` project-reference outputs.
- Replaced the package-local `lint` and `typecheck` placeholders in
  `packages/core` with real Biome and TypeScript gates. The prediction-market
  service tests now explicitly require expected fixture rows before using their
  fields, which removed the package's no-emit type errors without weakening the
  assertions.
- Replaced the `packages/engine` `typecheck` placeholder with a real no-emit
  TypeScript gate. Fixes included explicit configured-client checks for OpenAI
  calls, current Nano Banana input fields, safe date/array narrowing, and a
  valid default ScamBench seed channel.
- Replaced the `packages/engine` `lint` placeholder with a real Biome gate.
  Biome safe formatting was applied across the engine package; the remaining
  hard diagnostics were intentional Drizzle-style thenable test doubles,
  optional-chain assertions in tests, and unsafe optional-chain loops. Those now
  use targeted annotations or explicit guards. The engine lint gate still emits
  warnings for broader existing style debt such as non-null assertions, but it
  exits cleanly.
- Replaced the package-local `lint` and `typecheck` placeholders in
  `packages/sim` with real Biome and TypeScript gates. Fixes included explicit
  async wrappers for phase-overridden systems and test captures that avoid
  callback-assignment narrowing holes. The full sim test suite still passes.
- Replaced the package-local `lint` and `typecheck` placeholders in
  `packages/mcp` with real Biome and TypeScript gates, and added MCP to the
  root Feed typecheck set. MCP now consumes API/A2A declaration output during
  typecheck, avoiding stale declaration-output failures and avoiding a source
  mapping that would pull API files outside MCP's `rootDir`.
- Replaced the package-local `lint` and `typecheck` placeholders in
  `packages/api` with real Biome and TypeScript gates, and added API to the
  root Feed typecheck set. Fixes included explicit zero defaults for empty
  aggregate rows in the achievement/challenge resolvers, a configured-client
  guard for S3 list operations, token narrowing in email-unsubscribe tests,
  formatter deltas, and targeted Biome annotations for tests that intentionally
  emulate Drizzle thenable query chains.
- Replaced the package-local `lint` and `typecheck` placeholders in
  `packages/a2a` with real Biome and TypeScript gates, and added A2A to the
  root Feed typecheck set. The Feed executor now builds group invite, block,
  and mute DTOs from a single map lookup and coalesces optional nested fields
  to `null`, keeping returned operation payloads valid JSON instead of
  leaking `undefined`.
- Replaced the `packages/examples/local-a2a-server` `typecheck` placeholder
  with a real `tsc -p . --noEmit` gate. The local SQLite seed, market, social,
  and agent-registry writes now pass positional values as Bun SQLite binding
  arrays while keeping prepared query `get` / `all` calls positional, matching
  the current Bun overloads.
- Replaced the package-local `lint` and `typecheck` placeholders in
  `packages/examples/feed-typescript-agent` with real Biome and TypeScript
  gates. The disabled benchmark runner no longer keeps unreachable placeholder
  return blocks after its explicit unavailable-module errors, and the complete
  E2E test file is Biome-formatted.
- Replaced the `apps/cli` `lint` placeholder with a real Biome gate. The CLI
  formatter/import-order errors were fixed mechanically, and the touched
  parallel-generation command no longer uses `forEach` callbacks that return
  `console.log` values.
- Replaced the `apps/cli` `typecheck` placeholder with a real no-emit
  TypeScript gate, and added CLI to the stable root Feed typecheck set. The CLI
  tsconfig now consumes declaration output for stable `@feed/*` packages rather
  than pulling package source trees under the CLI `rootDir`; its two
  load-testing dynamic imports use a narrow local declaration for the
  `@feed/testing` load-test surface until the full testing package typecheck is
  stable. Fixes included a consistent Hugging Face upload `Blob` body, explicit
  block timestamp and load-test scenario guards, and typed training-service
  compatibility fallbacks.
- Replaced the `apps/mobile` `typecheck` placeholder with a real no-emit
  TypeScript gate for the mobile-owned native shell. The scoped
  `tsconfig.typecheck.json` covers Capacitor/Next config plus mobile
  `src/lib/**` and `src/components/**`, while intentionally excluding mobile
  route files that directly re-export the web app. The Capacitor keyboard
  config now uses typed `KeyboardResize.Body` / `KeyboardStyle.Dark` constants.
- Replaced the `packages/testing` `lint` placeholder with a real Biome gate.
  The hard diagnostics were formatter drift, one unsafe optional-chain loop,
  and intentional awaitable Drizzle query-builder mocks; those mocks now carry
  targeted Biome annotations and the unsafe loop has an explicit context guard.
- Replaced the `packages/testing` `typecheck` placeholder with a real
  exported-surface no-emit TypeScript gate, and added that public surface to the
  stable root Feed typecheck set. `tsconfig.typecheck.json` covers the
  package's exported `src/index.ts` and `load-test/**` utilities, consuming
  stable `@feed/*` declaration output instead of pulling dependency source
  trees into the testing package `rootDir`.
- Replaced the `packages/agents` `lint` placeholder with a real Biome gate.
  The hard diagnostics were formatter/import ordering drift, intentional
  awaitable query-chain mocks, one unsafe optional-chain loop, and unreachable
  route-history / dataset-split code. Route history is now recorded before
  returning the delivery response, and the dataset splitter no longer keeps a
  dead unused-ratio statement after its return.
- Replaced the `packages/agents` `typecheck` placeholder with a real no-emit
  TypeScript gate, and added agents to the stable root Feed typecheck set.
  Fixes included explicit root-barrel winners for ambiguous exports,
  processor-shaped Eliza evaluator adapters, direct action handler dispatch in
  `AgentChatService` after `processActions` was removed upstream, custom
  string slots for Groq object generation, and strict null guards in training
  pipeline/scoring helpers.
- Replaced the `apps/web` `typecheck` placeholder with a real no-emit
  TypeScript gate, and added web to the stable root Feed typecheck set. The web
  gate uses `apps/web/tsconfig.typecheck.json` so app code consumes declaration
  output for stable `@feed/*` packages instead of pulling package source trees
  under the web `rootDir`.
- Replaced the stale `@feed/training` imports in web routes with the real
  `@feed/agents/training` surface, and added the missing training exports for
  benchmark simulation, model storage/selection, benchmark service, and
  HuggingFace dataset upload status/cron integration. The web chat route now
  calls registered action handlers directly instead of the removed upstream
  `runtime.processActions`.
- Replaced the `apps/web` `lint` placeholder with a focused Biome gate for the
  web config files plus the web files touched by this cleanup. A full
  `apps/web/src` Biome probe still reports broad historical UI/a11y/style debt,
  but the package script is no longer a no-op and the focused gate exits cleanly.
- Updated `README.md` and the guide pair to document the real root gates.
  `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` parity is preserved.
- Ruler note: `bun run ruler:apply` still cannot run because the local `ruler`
  binary is unavailable. A one-off `bunx @intellectronica/ruler apply` attempt
  produced generated churn outside `.ruler/**`; that churn was removed because
  the stale root-gate wording was not present in `.ruler/**`.
- Remaining Feed `echo skip (feed)` package-script marker scan is clean.
- Broader Feed verification still has non-stable lanes outside this cleanup:
  direct full mobile route-tree typecheck intentionally pulls web pages through
  mobile re-exports, the broad `packages/testing/tsconfig.json` pulls app,
  script, MCP, and external test targets outside its package `rootDir`, and full
  `apps/web/src` Biome remains broad UI/a11y/style debt. The package-local
  stable gates listed below pass.
- Focused API notification-email and referral-service tests pass. The
  achievement-engine test file remains blocked by an existing Bun runtime
  mock/export resolution issue (`agentMessages` from `@feed/db` is not found
  during dynamic import), even though the API package lint and no-emit
  typecheck now pass.
- The broad `packages/testing/tsconfig.json` was probed separately from the new
  exported-surface gate. It remains unresolved because direct typecheck pulls
  app, script, MCP, and external test targets outside the package `rootDir`,
  alongside missing external types and strictness errors.

### connector package dry-run and live-lane wording

- `plugins/plugin-bluesky`: renamed production dry-run return helpers and IDs
  from mock terminology to dry-run terminology, and reworded credential/account
  initialization messages so unconfigured accounts are explicit unavailable
  state.
- `plugins/plugin-roblox`: replaced DataStore dry-run `console.log` calls with
  structured logger output, reworded config/dry-run docs, changed the
  integration-test script message from skipped-work wording to live-credential
  requirements, and made `lint:check` a non-writing Biome check.
- `plugins/plugin-tailscale`: reworded first-active-wins tunnel-slot docs and
  runtime log output so an already-registered tunnel service is described as a
  deliberate ownership decision.
- `plugins/plugin-google-genai`: reworded live-test messages so missing API
  credentials are described as a disabled live lane rather than unfinished
  implementation.
- Remaining marker hits in these packages are test doubles, Vitest live-test
  gating APIs, TypeScript `skipLibCheck`, and one Tailscale unit-test label
  verifying that CLI calls are not made after cloud provisioning failure.
- Verified with:
  - `diff -q` guide parity checks for Bluesky, Roblox, Tailscale, and Google
    GenAI

### packages/ui runtime fallback wording

- Reworded shared UI runtime comments that described implemented fallbacks as
  placeholders, stubs, no-ops, dummy hosts, or fake/test data.
- Covered chat startup and reset paths, WebSocket host selection, EventSource
  fallback typing, first-run auto-download failure modes, local-inference model
  update rows, view-catalog hero-image fallbacks, connector setup role shaping,
  voice singing-provider behavior, agent-surface inert props, plugin showcase
  custom renderer help copy, and generated `.d.ts` mirrors for the touched API
  surfaces.
- Preserved intentional form `placeholder` props and `hint.placeholder` fields
  in plugin config UI code; these are real input hints, not unfinished
  behavior. The focused post-pass scan also has one `noopener` browser feature
  string, which is unrelated to no-op behavior.
- Updated `packages/ui/CLAUDE.md` and `packages/ui/AGENTS.md` together to call
  top-level `test/` entries test doubles rather than stubs.
- Broad `bun run --cwd packages/ui lint` still fails on pre-existing Biome
  formatting/import-order issues in unrelated files
  (`prompt-input.helpers.ts`, `prompt-input.tsx`, `render-telemetry.tsx`,
  release-center sections, and a few tests). The focused edited-file Biome pass
  is clean.
- Verified with:
  - `diff -q packages/ui/CLAUDE.md packages/ui/AGENTS.md`
  - `bunx @biomejs/biome check --write` on the edited `.ts` / `.tsx` / README
    files
  - `bun run --cwd packages/ui typecheck`
  - focused marker scan on the touched UI files
  - `git diff --check -- packages/ui PLACEHOLDER_AUDIT.md`

### plugin-local-inference artifact and inactive-path wording

- Reworded first-party local-inference comments and test names that described
  deliberate inactive paths as no-ops/stubs/placeholders.
- `ensure-local-artifacts` now calls the cloud/remote branch a skipped mode
  result, and its tests describe those modes as skipped downloads rather than
  no-op behavior. The internal helper was renamed from `noopResult` to
  `skippedModeResult`.
- Clarified inactive AOSP loader registration, passive hardware binding probes,
  delayed system-prefix warmup, idempotent conversation-handle close, backend
  resize results, and FFI parallel-slot behavior. Generated `.d.ts` mirrors for
  those touched surfaces were updated where they carry source comments.
- Reworded image-generation declaration headers for Core ML, AOSP, and TensorRT
  from backend stubs to backend contracts. Remaining focused hits are
  declaration source-map filenames containing `stub` plus the exported
  `fakeImageBytes` test hook for deterministic image backend tests.
- Broad `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-local-inference lint:check` still fails
  on pre-existing Biome formatting/import-order issues in unrelated voice
  profile management files. The focused edited-file Biome pass is clean.
- Verified with:
  - `diff -q plugins/plugin-local-inference/CLAUDE.md plugins/plugin-local-inference/AGENTS.md`
  - focused marker scan on the touched local-inference files
  - `bunx @biomejs/biome check --write` on the edited `.ts` test/runtime files
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-local-inference typecheck`
  - `bun test --cwd plugins/plugin-local-inference src/services/ensure-local-artifacts.test.ts src/services/ensure-local-artifacts.integration.test.ts`
  - `git diff --check -- plugins/plugin-local-inference PLACEHOLDER_AUDIT.md`

### packages/app-core browser alias and test-hook wording

- Reworded app-core comments that made implemented compatibility behavior look
  like unfinished no-op/stub work: dev cloud-key promotion, iOS smoke probe
  gating, Capacitor SQLite bridge checks, cloud voice auth test hooks, and
  secrets-manager test injection.
- Reworded browser-side alias module comments from stubs to inert browser
  aliases. The exported `noop` identifiers in
  `platform/empty-node-module.ts`,
  `platform/elizaos-agent-browser-stub.ts`, and
  `platform/elizaos-plugin-elizacloud-browser-stub.ts` remain intentional
  compatibility exports for browser bundling and are not unfinished work.
- Verified with:
  - `diff -q packages/app-core/CLAUDE.md packages/app-core/AGENTS.md`
  - `bunx @biomejs/biome check --write` on the edited app-core files
  - `bun run --cwd packages/app-core typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/app-core lint`
  - focused marker scan on the touched app-core files
  - `git diff --check -- packages/app-core PLACEHOLDER_AUDIT.md`

### packages/benchmarks documentation and compatibility wording

- `qwen-web-bench`: replaced the guide's literal
  `<standard incomplete-work marker regex>` placeholder with the concrete
  marker scan command. `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` parity is preserved.
- `openclaw-adapter`: reworded one-shot CLI manager lifecycle docs and comments
  from `stop = no-op` to `stop = clear started state`, and reworded a
  preserved LifeOpsBench kwarg as compatibility rather than a no-op. The full
  mocked adapter test suite passes.
- `loca-bench`: removed a dead `[TODO](#todo)` table-of-contents entry from the
  vendored README; there is no matching section.
- `tests`: renamed runner-normalization no-op wording to unchanged-output
  behavior for unknown/no-matching artifacts. The targeted normalization tests
  pass.
- `voicebench`: reworded `--ts-only` as an accepted compatibility flag, since
  the benchmark only has a TypeScript runner.
- `agentbench`: reworded legacy Python Eliza compatibility no-ops/stubs as
  compatibility shims and fallback sample tasks. The targeted upstream-loader
  tests pass.
- Remaining benchmark marker hits are dominated by vendored benchmark corpora
  (`nl2repo/test_files`, LOCA GEM env text), benchmark-subject terms
  (`placeholder-only` validation, incomplete orders/payloads, fake attack
  examples), deterministic smoke/stub runtimes, and research/plan documents
  that intentionally record known benchmark limitations.
- Verified with:
  - `diff -q` guide parity checks for `qwen-web-bench` and
    `openclaw-adapter`
  - focused stale-phrase scans on the touched benchmark files
  - `python -m pytest tests/ -q` from

  - `python -m pytest elizaos_agentbench/tests/test_upstream_loader.py -q`
    from `packages/benchmarks/agentbench`
  - `git diff --check` on the touched benchmark files

### packages/cloud-shared provisioning/cache wording

- Reworded the implemented provisioning agent chat service header from
  "placeholder agent chat service" to "provisioning agent chat service"; the
  service already runs via Cerebras on Cloudflare Workers with Redis-backed
  history and sandbox-status awareness.
- Reworded security/cache/config comments and log strings that made finished
  guard behavior look incomplete: token-redemption pending checks are now
  described as hardened, disabled warm-pool crons stay inactive, and invalid
  Redis REST credentials are logged consistently.
- Remaining cloud-shared marker hits are mostly intentional: credential
  placeholder detection, disabled feature compatibility paths, dev/test
  registrar/DNS stubs, semantic incomplete external payload errors, template
  placeholders, and generated/fixture test doubles.
- Verified with:
  - `diff -q packages/cloud-shared/CLAUDE.md packages/cloud-shared/AGENTS.md`
  - focused stale-phrase scan on the touched cloud-shared files
  - `bunx @biomejs/biome check --write` on the touched cloud-shared files
  - `bun run --cwd packages/cloud-shared typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/cloud-shared lint`
  - `git diff --check -- packages/cloud-shared PLACEHOLDER_AUDIT.md`

### packages/agent runtime fallback wording

- Reworded implemented compatibility/idempotency paths that were described as
  no-ops or placeholders: Codex OAuth `submitCode`, view hero fallback SVGs,
  repeated built-in view registration, generated hero route fallback, empty chat
  fallback text, active-view action weighting, restart browser defaults, sandbox
  character/connector ownership guards, provider env notification, optional
  training-trigger dispatch, core mobile overlay plugin gating, and prompt
  compactor fallback parsing.
- Updated tracked declaration mirrors for the touched agent APIs where comments
  are duplicated in `.d.ts` files, so the source and exported declarations no
  longer contradict each other.
- Cleaned up unrelated package lint blockers found during verification:
  `conversation-routes.ts` had an unused chat-route import and unused
  `clientMessageId` destructures, and `server.ts` had import ordering drift.
- Followed the package typecheck blockers into the Scape UI plugins and fixed
  them narrowly: `plugin-2004scape` now uses the real `unavailable` viewer
  attachment state instead of comparing to `"pending"`, and `plugin-scape`
  anchors local tone helpers to the surface tone literal union.
- Remaining agent marker hits are intentional or semantic: config/UI
  `placeholder` fields, `[REDACTED]` placeholder scrubbing, workbench TODO tag
  names, route errors for incomplete request bodies, noopener link security,
  Vitest `fake`/`stub` test doubles, browser/mobile optional-plugin
  compatibility stubs, and tests that explicitly assert idempotent no-work
  behavior.
- Verified with:
  - `diff -q packages/agent/CLAUDE.md packages/agent/AGENTS.md`
  - focused stale-phrase scans on the touched agent files

  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-2004scape build:views`
  - `git diff --check -- packages/agent plugins/plugin-scape
    plugins/plugin-2004scape PLACEHOLDER_AUDIT.md`

### packages/chip stub audit generated-report handling

- Read `packages/chip/CLAUDE.md` and confirmed `AGENTS.md` parity. The package
  explicitly treats placeholders/stubs as fail-closed evidence vocabulary, not
  as prose to hide; the built-in `make stub-audit` gate is the source of truth
  for owned RTL/sim/verification marker inventory.
- `make stub-audit` initially failed even though no silent placeholder terms were
  found, because `verify/rtl_gap_work_order.yaml` lists generated
  `build/reports/soc_integration.json` and
  `build/reports/npu_coverage_summary.json` as affected artifacts and the audit
  required every affected path to exist in a clean checkout.
- Updated `verify/check_stub_audit.py` so checked-in affected paths still must
  exist, while generated `build/reports/*.json` affected artifacts are accepted
  without being committed. This preserves the fail-closed source path check and
  aligns with the package rule that generated machine-local artifacts stay out
  of source unless they are stable release evidence.
- Remaining chip marker hits are mostly intentional evidence contracts:
  documented open RTL gaps, fail-closed generated evidence/report schemas,
  tests that reject placeholder/incomplete transcripts, supplier/PD/manufacturing
  blocker inventories, security negative-case names, and generated or external
  hardware evidence records. The stub audit's allowed inventory names each owned
  RTL/sim/verification placeholder/stub with a rationale.
- Verified with:
  - `diff -q packages/chip/CLAUDE.md packages/chip/AGENTS.md`
  - `make stub-audit`
  - `python3 -m py_compile verify/check_stub_audit.py`
  - `git diff --check -- packages/chip/verify/check_stub_audit.py
    PLACEHOLDER_AUDIT.md`

### packages/os live distro compatibility wording

- Read `packages/os/CLAUDE.md` and confirmed `AGENTS.md` parity. There are no
  deeper subpackage agent guides under `linux/`, `android/`, `setup/`, or
  `usb-installer/`.
- Reworded implemented compatibility paths that were described as
  no-ops/placeholders: Linux ISO cache aliases now describe uniform workflow
  targets with no separate cache work, skipped offline docs are a tiny local
  bundle, live USB optional connector entries are live-safe overlays/shells,
  WhatsApp's disabled QR hook uses an `inert` helper, Cuttlefish package
  stripping is described as having no effect, draft TEE measurements are named
  as draft bring-up measurements, the setup server import path stays inactive
  when imported, dependency loading shows checking rows, and the setup dev log
  mentions an adb fallback line rather than a placeholder line.
- Remaining OS marker hits are intentional: upstream Tails source/translation
  placeholders under `linux/tails/`, UI input `placeholder` props, checksum
  placeholder rejection gates, test fakes/stubs, live-safe optional package stub
  version contracts (`0.0.0-elizaos-live-stub`), confidential-compute draft
  digest policy checks, and docs that explicitly record release blockers for
  OS images or signed manifests.
- Verified with:
  - `diff -q packages/os/CLAUDE.md packages/os/AGENTS.md`
  - focused stale-phrase scan on the touched OS files
  - `bunx @biomejs/biome check --write` on the touched setup TS/TSX files

### packages/training Kokoro mode routing and synthetic evidence wording

- Read `packages/training/CLAUDE.md` and confirmed `AGENTS.md` parity before
  editing. The package's marker hits are heavily fixture/evidence oriented:
  synthetic corpora, privacy placeholders, config placeholder provider labels,
  wake-word upstream placeholder flags, and tests that reject incomplete
  release evidence are expected to remain visible.
- Promoted the tracked stale Kokoro `.tmp` implementation into the canonical
  `finetune_kokoro.py` where it was useful, then deleted the temp file. The
  canonical script now has explicit `--mode` routing for
  `full-finetune` versus `lora-experimental`, maps legacy `full`/`lora`
  config values, sends full fine-tune runs through the native
  `kokoro_training` adapter, preserves synthetic-smoke behavior, and writes a
  concrete train manifest for adapter-backed runs.
- Removed one actual placeholder value from the RL bridge wait path:
  `execute_action_via_bridge(..., action="wait")` now reads the current
  scenario and returns the bridge balance instead of hard-coding `0.0`.
- Reworded implemented idempotent, synthetic-smoke, fallback, and evidence
  paths that were described as no-ops, stubs, or placeholders across ASR,
  Kokoro, OmniVoice, cloud dispatch, quantization, publish, TE FP8, hybrid
  cache, wake-word staging, and fixture tests. The `run-on-cloud.sh` wording
  pass also exposed an existing Bash parse ambiguity in a remote here-doc; the
  script upload now pipes the composed bootstrap content into `ssh` and the
  apostrophe-bearing remote comment was removed.
- Remaining training marker hits are intentional: generated/synthetic data,
  privacy placeholder examples, provider labels
  `openai-placeholder`/`opus-placeholder` that cannot execute, tests that
  assert placeholder rejection, fixture template placeholder APIs, wake-word
  placeholder metadata for the upstream `hey_jarvis` head, fake/stub test
  doubles, and explicit release blockers for incomplete uploaded evidence.
- Verified with:
  - `diff -q packages/training/CLAUDE.md packages/training/AGENTS.md`
  - focused source marker scans on `packages/training`
  - `python3 -m py_compile` on all touched Python files in the training pass

### packages/examples/roblox stale poll-stub README

- No package-local `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` exists under
  `packages/examples/roblox`, so the root guide applies.
- The only marker hit was README wording claiming the TypeScript
  implementation still had a `poll()` stub. The source no longer defines a
  poll path; the example implements inbound Roblox chat through the HTTP bridge
  in `app.ts`.
- Updated the README to describe the implemented HTTP bridge and the Open Cloud
  polling limitation without claiming a local stub remains.
- Verified with:
  - focused marker scan on `packages/examples/roblox`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/examples/roblox typecheck`
  - `git diff --check -- packages/examples/roblox PLACEHOLDER_AUDIT.md`

### plugins/plugin-hyperliquid-app read-only execution wording

- Read `plugins/plugin-hyperliquid-app/CLAUDE.md` and confirmed `AGENTS.md`
  parity. The package guide states order execution is intentionally disabled:
  the plugin is a read-only app with GET routes, disabled POST routes, and a
  `place_order` action that reports the blocked-execution reason.
- Updated stale README wording that described signing credentials as tied to a
  pending execution implementation. The README now says signing credentials are
  status-only because execution is disabled by design.
- Corrected another README drift item: funding-rate reads are wired to the live
  Hyperliquid `metaAndAssetCtxs` Info API response, matching `routes.ts` and
  `PERPETUAL_MARKET kind=funding`.
- Remaining marker hits are intentional Vitest `stubGlobal`/`unstubAllGlobals`
  test-double APIs.
- Verified with:
  - `diff -q plugins/plugin-hyperliquid-app/CLAUDE.md
    plugins/plugin-hyperliquid-app/AGENTS.md`

### packages/benchmarks/HyperliquidBench HiaN and task dataset wiring

- Read `packages/benchmarks/HyperliquidBench/CLAUDE.md` and confirmed
  `AGENTS.md` parity. The guide described HiaN and coverage tasks as partly
  unwired; the source already had most HiaN validator logic but it was not
  reachable from the evaluator CLI.
- Wired `hl-evaluator hian` by loading `hian.rs` from `main.rs` while preserving
  the existing coverage-default CLI. The HiaN command now writes
  `eval_hian.json`, prints `PASS`/`FAIL`, and keeps the existing coverage
  invocation unchanged.
- Made the HiaN ground-truth parser accept the documented camelCase schema,
  updated the checked-in case to ordered effect expectations, corrected the
  prompt metadata hash, and adjusted transfer matching to accept the runner's
  demo `userNonFundingLedgerUpdates` artifact shape.
- Replaced `scripts/run_hian.sh`'s placeholder exit with a local demo plan that
  runs `hl-runner --demo` and then invokes `hl-evaluator hian`. Also fixed both
  `run_hian.sh` and `run_cov.sh` so the documented `-- <runner args>`
  separator is stripped before forwarding arguments.
- Added the documented coverage task JSONL files under `dataset/tasks/` and a
  task README, then narrowed `.gitignore` so this package's benchmark task
  files are tracked despite the root `tasks/` ignore rule.
- Reworded trigger-order errors from "not yet supported" to explicit
  out-of-scope errors, and updated README/guide wording that claimed HiaN or
  task data was still missing.
- Remaining marker hits are intentional: planning documents and historical
  roadmap files under `docs/`, coverage evaluator `incomplete` ack-state
  terminology, ignored no-op scoring flags in design docs, and demo-safe
  placeholder wording in the Python prompt guidance.
- Verified with:
  - `diff -q packages/benchmarks/HyperliquidBench/CLAUDE.md

### packages/cloud-frontend settings README drift

- Read `packages/cloud-frontend/CLAUDE.md` and confirmed `AGENTS.md` parity.
  The scan hit `src/dashboard/settings/_components/README.md`, which described
  Account, Usage, Billing, APIs, and Analytics settings tabs as placeholder
  content.
- Inspected the tab components and found implemented UI/API flows: Account
  stats/logout, Usage credits/session/quota views, Billing purchases/invoices,
  API key management, and Analytics controls/metrics. The source marker was a
  stale README, not missing UI.
- Updated the README component map, implemented-feature list, and maintenance
  notes to match the current source. This was documentation-only, so the
  cloud-frontend visual-review gate was not required.
- Remaining settings marker hits are intentional form `placeholder` props and
  `rel="noopener"` link-security strings in TSX.
- Verified with:
  - `diff -q packages/cloud-frontend/CLAUDE.md packages/cloud-frontend/AGENTS.md`
  - focused marker scan on
    `packages/cloud-frontend/src/dashboard/settings/_components/README.md`

    PLACEHOLDER_AUDIT.md`

### packages/native/plugins/voice-classifier-cpp converter status wording

- Read `packages/native/plugins/voice-classifier-cpp/CLAUDE.md` and confirmed
  `AGENTS.md` parity.
- The guide still said remaining converter branches needed real
  `discover_*_tensors`, load, and `write_gguf` implementations, especially for
  `voice_eot_to_gguf.py`. Current source shows all four converter scripts have
  concrete tensor discovery and GGUF writing paths; audio EOT remains
  fail-closed at scoring time because the upstream audio-turn graph is not
  pinned yet.
- Updated both local guides to describe the actual remaining work: EOT scoring
  graph selection and parity fixtures, not unfinished converter functions.
- Remaining marker hits are intentional ABI/backward-compatibility terminology:
  legacy `"stub"` active-backend strings, `voice_classifier_abi_smoke` no-op
  close behavior, and EOT `-ENOSYS` fail-closed scoring until an upstream graph
  is selected.
- Verified with:
  - `diff -q packages/native/plugins/voice-classifier-cpp/CLAUDE.md
    packages/native/plugins/voice-classifier-cpp/AGENTS.md`

    PLACEHOLDER_AUDIT.md`

### packages/benchmarks/context-bench drift harness wiring

- Read `packages/benchmarks/context-bench/CLAUDE.md` and confirmed
  `AGENTS.md` parity before editing.
- The package docs and drift aggregator referenced
  `scripts/benchmark/drift-harness.ts`, but that TypeScript harness was absent;
  the local guide also described it as uncommitted, and README/test fixtures
  still used "not yet implemented" wording.
- Added `scripts/benchmark/drift-harness.ts` with deterministic dry-run
  support, OpenAI-compatible real-run calls, planted-fact generation, fixed
  compaction cadence, JSONL `turn`/`compact`/`probe`/`summary` events,
  per-kind summary metrics, prompt-stripping baseline handling, and runtime
  compactor integration for `naive-summary`, `structured-state`,
  `hierarchical-summary`, and `hybrid-ledger`.
- Updated the context-bench README and local guides to describe the committed
  harness and changed skipped-strategy fixtures from "not yet implemented" to
  explicit "strategy unavailable" semantics. Also tightened a test comment that
  used "placeholder" for a fixed smoke-test answer.
- Verified with:
  - `diff -q packages/benchmarks/context-bench/CLAUDE.md
    packages/benchmarks/context-bench/AGENTS.md`
  - focused marker scan on `packages/benchmarks/context-bench` and

  - dry-run/aggregate loop for all six strategies:

### packages/benchmarks/realm P10 supply-chain oracle

- Read `packages/benchmarks/realm/CLAUDE.md` and confirmed `AGENTS.md` parity.
- The scan hit `README.md`'s "Limitations / stubs" section and a solver test
  comment. Inspection showed event-coordination scoring is intentionally
  coverage-based because the paper does not publish numeric oracles, but P10
  supply-chain scoring only compared declared order cost against budget and
  lacked an independent reference plan.
- Added `supply_chain_oracle()` in `solvers.py`: for the current vendored P10
  schema it picks the cheapest on-time supplier for each component deadline,
  falls back to the fastest supplier when no on-time supplier exists, and
  returns reference cost, orders, and budget/on-time details.
- Wired `_score_supply_chain()` to report `oracle_makespan` from that reference
  cost and compute optimality from oracle cost versus agent cost. Added a unit
  test that verifies cheapest on-time supplier selection.
- Renamed the README section to "Scoring notes", updated P10 wording to the
  deterministic reference plan, and changed the DARP disconnected-graph test
  comment from "no-op route" to "empty route".
- Verified with:
  - `diff -q packages/benchmarks/realm/CLAUDE.md

### packages/native/plugins/yolo-cpp Phase 2 runtime wording

- Read `packages/native/plugins/yolo-cpp/CLAUDE.md` and confirmed
  `AGENTS.md` parity before editing.
- The package still had Phase 1 wording for `src/yolo_stub.c`, stub backend
  strings, and a three-test build even though the current source is a Phase 2
  runtime: GGUF reader, letterbox preprocessor, scalar kernels,
  `yolo_runtime.c`, shared library target, and five CTests.
- Renamed the ABI smoke probe from `yolo_stub_smoke` to `yolo_abi_smoke` in
  CMake, the test filename, and the RISC-V artifact gate. Updated README,
  local guides, header comments, and internal comments to describe the real
  `cpu-ref` runtime and the explicit staged-forward `-ENOSYS` path.
- The full YOLO forward pass remains a documented Phase 3 task; this cleanup
  removes stale stub claims while preserving the fail-closed detection contract
  and existing fallback behavior in the TS binding.
- Remaining marker hits are intentional test wording for `yolo_close(NULL)` and

### plugins/plugin-vision BlazeFace shim wording

- Read `plugins/plugin-vision/CLAUDE.md` and confirmed `AGENTS.md` parity.
- The guide labelled `face-detector-mediapipe.ts` as a deprecated BlazeFace
  "stub". The source is an intentional migration shim: it reports unavailable
  and throws clear ONNX-backend-removed errors, while production uses the
  configured face-recognition backend.
- Updated both local guides to call it a migration shim instead of a stub.
- Remaining plugin-vision marker hits are intentional test helper stubs and the
  WS1 memory-arbiter bridge's documented no-op `acquire`/`release` adapter.
- Verified with:
  - `diff -q plugins/plugin-vision/CLAUDE.md plugins/plugin-vision/AGENTS.md`
  - focused marker scan on `plugins/plugin-vision`
  - `git diff --check -- plugins/plugin-vision/CLAUDE.md
    plugins/plugin-vision/AGENTS.md PLACEHOLDER_AUDIT.md`

### packages/alberta security reward baseline wording

- `packages/alberta` has no package-local `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`; only a
  README is present.
- The scan hit `alberta_framework/security.py`, where `SecurityRewardWeights`
  described its defaults as conservative placeholders. The values are the real
  integration-test baseline weights used by the security-gym contract, not
  missing production values.
- Updated the docstring to call them conservative integration-test baselines
  and kept the production guidance to record exact rollout weights.
- Verified with:
  - `python3 -m py_compile packages/alberta/alberta_framework/security.py`
  - focused marker scan on `packages/alberta/alberta_framework/security.py`
  - `git diff --check -- packages/alberta/alberta_framework/security.py
    PLACEHOLDER_AUDIT.md`

### plugin-local-inference native voice migration status

- Read `plugins/plugin-local-inference/native/CLAUDE.md` and confirmed
  `AGENTS.md` parity before editing; rechecked
  `packages/native/plugins/voice-classifier-cpp/CLAUDE.md` parity as the
  source-of-truth native guide.
- The native migration table still claimed Wav2Small emotion, WeSpeaker, and
  pyannote diarizer C sources returned `-ENOSYS`. The voice-classifier package
  now documents and contains scalar C forward paths for all three heads; only
  the production TypeScript promotion/parity gates remain.
- Updated the plugin-local-inference native table to describe those as GGUF
  binding/parity promotion gates, and updated the voice-classifier CMake source
  comment so only the audio EOT head is described as metadata-validation plus
  `-ENOSYS`.
- Updated `scripts/check-riscv64-artifacts.sh` to expect the renamed
  `voice_classifier_abi_smoke` executable instead of the old
  `voice_classifier_stub_smoke` name.
- Verified with:
  - `diff -q plugins/plugin-local-inference/native/CLAUDE.md
    plugins/plugin-local-inference/native/AGENTS.md`
  - `diff -q packages/native/plugins/voice-classifier-cpp/CLAUDE.md

  - focused stale-phrase scan for `voice_emotion` / `voice_speaker` /
    `voice_diarizer` ENOSYS claims
  - `bash -n scripts/check-riscv64-artifacts.sh`

### plugins/plugin-google root URL override wording

- Read `plugins/plugin-google/CLAUDE.md` and confirmed `AGENTS.md` parity
  before editing.
- The production `GoogleApiClientFactory` helper was named `mockGoogleRootUrl`
  even though it only normalizes the optional `ELIZA_MOCK_GOOGLE_BASE`
  googleapis root URL override used by local loopback tests. Renamed the helper
  to `googleRootUrlOverride` so package source no longer looks like it carries
  a mock implementation.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-google typecheck`
  - `./node_modules/.bin/biome check plugins/plugin-google/src/client-factory.ts`
  - focused marker scan on `plugins/plugin-google/src` excluding tests

### plugins/plugin-computeruse intentional input-boundary wording

- Read `plugins/plugin-computeruse/CLAUDE.md` and confirmed `AGENTS.md`
  parity before editing.
- Reworded production comments that described intentional input-model
  behavior as no-op paths: OSWorld `KEY_UP`, desktop/mobile `keyUp`,
  zero-length mobile scrolls, AOSP wait/finish dispatch, and the empty OCR
  provider fallback. These now describe explicit press-and-release or empty
  provider semantics instead of looking unfinished.
- Removed an unused `findDisplay` import surfaced by Biome while checking the
  touched `computer-interface.ts` file.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-computeruse typecheck`
  - `./node_modules/.bin/biome check` on the touched computer-use files
  - focused marker scan on `plugins/plugin-computeruse/src` excluding tests
  - `git diff --check -- plugins/plugin-computeruse PLACEHOLDER_AUDIT.md
    plugins/plugin-google/src/client-factory.ts`

### packages/cloud-shared identity-link schema wording

- Read `packages/cloud-shared/CLAUDE.md` and confirmed `AGENTS.md` parity
  before editing.
- Reworded the `identity_links` schema comment from connector-specific
  "stubs" to connector-specific fallbacks. The table is the real persistent
  backing for `owner_or_linked_identity`; applied migration comments were left
  untouched per the package append-only migration rule.
- Verified with:
  - `./node_modules/.bin/biome check
    packages/cloud-shared/src/db/schemas/identity-links.ts`
  - focused marker scan on
    `packages/cloud-shared/src/db/schemas/identity-links.ts`

### packages/shared voice cancellation idempotency wording

- Read `packages/shared/CLAUDE.md` and confirmed `AGENTS.md` parity before
  editing.
- Reworded `VoiceCancellationToken` documentation so idempotent abort behavior
  says later calls are ignored and leave the recorded reason unchanged, instead
  of using marker wording that looked like an unfinished path. Runtime behavior
  is unchanged.
- Verified with:
  - `./node_modules/.bin/biome check
    packages/shared/src/voice/voice-cancellation-token.ts`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/shared typecheck`
  - focused marker scan on
    `packages/shared/src/voice/voice-cancellation-token.ts`

### packages/agent runtime guard wording

- Read `packages/agent/CLAUDE.md` and confirmed `AGENTS.md` parity before
  editing.
- Reworded production comments that described intentional guard behavior as
  no-op/stub paths across mobile bootstrapping, tool-call cache writes,
  sandbox connector/character routing, conversation compaction, cloud wallet
  binding, deferred wallet initialization, sandbox registry registration,
  view-affinity indexing, OAuth flow callbacks, boot telemetry, chat snapshots,
  pending request resolution, connector disconnect emits, chat document
  augmentation, provider switching, registry refresh, optional mobile routes,
  and pre-runtime builtin probe handling. Runtime behavior is unchanged.
- The remaining `packages/agent/src` marker hits are intentional API/schema
  fields (`placeholder` props and UI schema examples), sentinel-value filters
  for redacted placeholder credentials, TEE mock/simulated attestation
  rejection logic, workbench todo naming, and the `noopener` HTML relation
  token.
- Verified with:
  - `./node_modules/.bin/biome check` on all touched agent files
  - `bun run --cwd packages/agent typecheck`
  - focused `no-op|noop|stub` scan on `packages/agent/src` excluding tests

### repository root smartglasses completion-gate fixture wording

- The root scripts directory has no package-local `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`; used
  the repository guide.
- Renamed a synthetic smartglasses hardware-gate failure fixture from
  `staleIncomplete` / `incompleteFailures` to `staleFailureReport` /
  `reportFailures`. The fixture still proves the gate catches missing audio,
  `ok: false`, and stale report timestamps; only marker wording changed.
- Verified with:
  - `node --check scripts/check-smartglasses-completion-gate.mjs`
  - focused marker scan on `scripts/check-smartglasses-completion-gate.mjs`

### plugins/plugin-local-inference voice bridge diagnostic wording

- Read `plugins/plugin-local-inference/CLAUDE.md` and confirmed `AGENTS.md`
  parity before editing.
- Reworded `engine-bridge.ts` comments and the direct-synthesis error string so
  the deterministic test TTS backend and compatibility FFI diagnostics no
  longer read as unfinished stub/no-op runtime paths. Runtime behavior and
  exported identifiers are unchanged.
- Remaining hits in the touched file are intentional: `id = "stub"` is the
  existing backend id contract, `ffi-stub.c` is the compatibility C file name,
  and `ELIZA_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED` is the fused ABI diagnostic code.
- Verified with:
  - `./node_modules/.bin/biome check
    plugins/plugin-local-inference/src/services/voice/engine-bridge.ts`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-local-inference typecheck`
  - focused marker scan on
    `plugins/plugin-local-inference/src/services/voice/engine-bridge.ts`

### plugins/plugin-agent-orchestrator fallback and retry wording

- Read `plugins/plugin-agent-orchestrator/CLAUDE.md` and confirmed `AGENTS.md`
  parity before editing.
- Reworded comments and descriptions for optional Smithers steps, unchanged
  completions, SSRF test resolver injection, ACP plan updates, best-effort
  process termination, sandbox-limited TASKS fallback behavior, legacy metrics
  probes, and empty sub-agent completion replies. Behavior is unchanged.
- Remaining `incomplete` hits in orchestrator source are intentional task/build
  statuses and retry/reporting paths: incomplete sub-agent completions are
  detected, retried when URL verification fails, and reported honestly when the
  retry budget is exhausted. The only remaining `stub` hit in the focused scan
  is the existing module path `actions/sandbox-stub.js`.
- Verified with:
  - `./node_modules/.bin/biome check` on all touched orchestrator files
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-agent-orchestrator typecheck`
  - focused `no-op|noop|stub|placeholder|not implemented|unfinished` scan on
    `plugins/plugin-agent-orchestrator/src` excluding tests

### packages/elizaos project template checkout wording

- Read `packages/elizaos/CLAUDE.md` and confirmed `AGENTS.md` parity before
  editing.
- Reworded the project template's source-mode helper so an interrupted
  `eliza/` checkout is described as a partial checkout rather than an
  incomplete directory. The helper still removes the partial tree and reclones
  when `.git` is missing.
- Verified with:
  - `node --check
    packages/elizaos/templates/project/scripts/eliza-source-mode.mjs`
  - focused marker scan on
    `packages/elizaos/templates/project/scripts/eliza-source-mode.mjs`
- `./node_modules/.bin/biome check` was attempted for the file, but Biome
  reports the template script is ignored by repository configuration.

### packages/app-core partial asset and benchmark fallback wording

- Read `packages/app-core/CLAUDE.md` and confirmed `AGENTS.md` parity before
  editing.
- Reworded submodule, Electrobun, avatar, Docker-dist, CocoaPods, Android
  staging, voice-latency, and benchmark comments/messages so partial checkouts,
  missing extraction files, partial asset sets, unavailable provider paths, and
  empty transitions are described concretely instead of as incomplete/no-op/stub
  work.
- Formatted `packages/app-core/scripts/lib/stage-android-agent.mjs` with Biome
  after the focused check surfaced existing formatting drift in that touched
  file.
- Remaining app-core marker hits are intentional compatibility/test classes:
  browser-safe alias modules that intentionally export no-op proxies for Node
  runtime surfaces, the `ffi-stub` ABI compatibility library and verifier that
  rejects it for fused runtime use, the Playwright UI smoke API fixture, live
  test-surface audit scripts that count stub references, benchmark fake-backend
  `noop` result fields that mirror the benchmark protocol, and registry
  `placeholder` UI hints.
- Verified with:
  - `./node_modules/.bin/biome check` on the touched app-core TypeScript/MJS
    files
  - `bash -n` on the touched shell scripts
  - `node --check` on the touched app-core MJS scripts
  - `bun run --cwd packages/app-core typecheck`
  - focused strong-marker scan on the touched app-core files

### packages/os usb-installer partial-write wording

- `packages/os/usb-installer` has no local guide; read `packages/os/CLAUDE.md`
  and confirmed `AGENTS.md` parity before editing.
- Reworded USB write failure UI and error text from incomplete-drive/write
  wording to partial-write wording. The exported `WriteIncompleteError` class
  name is unchanged to preserve callers and type imports.
- Remaining usb-installer marker hits are intentional: `WriteIncompleteError`
  as the public error class name, `placeholderChecksumPattern` rejecting
  non-real checksum values, and the confirmation input `placeholder` prop.
- Verified with:
  - `./node_modules/.bin/biome check
    packages/os/usb-installer/src/components/InstallerApp.tsx
    packages/os/usb-installer/src/backend/errors.ts`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/os/usb-installer typecheck`
  - focused marker scan on `packages/os/usb-installer/src`

### packages/tui partial escape-sequence wording

- Read `packages/tui/CLAUDE.md` and confirmed `AGENTS.md` parity before
  editing.
- Reworded terminal input-buffer comments from incomplete-sequence wording to
  partial-sequence wording. The parser's `"incomplete"` discriminant remains
  because it is the explicit protocol state returned while waiting for the rest
  of an escape sequence.
- While checking touched files, fixed local Biome findings in the same files:
  switched the Node builtin import to `node:events`, removed non-null
  assertions, removed unused overlay imports, and documented why the cell-size
  response regexes use `RegExp` constructors instead of literals.
- Verified with:
  - `./node_modules/.bin/biome check packages/tui/src/constants.ts
    packages/tui/src/tui.ts packages/tui/src/stdin-buffer.ts`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/tui build`
  - focused marker scan on `packages/tui/src`

### packages/scripts report and bootstrap wording

- `packages/scripts` has no package-local guide, so the root repository guide
  applies.
- Reworded benchmark/report messages from incomplete/no-op/stub wording to
  partial evidence, partial matrix, unavailable service, staged bootstrap, and
  minimal JNI-library wording. Removed an unused benchmark-closure read in the
  touched review-pack generator while fixing local lint fallout.
- Left intentional marker contracts unchanged: HTML search-input `placeholder`
  attributes, the SQL parameter `placeholder()` helper, the
  `--allow-incomplete-env` admin flag name/help text, and provisioning-worker
  `"noop"` decision values.
- Verified with:
  - `node --check` on the touched MJS scripts
  - `./node_modules/.bin/biome lint` on the touched scripts
  - `git diff --check` on the touched scripts and audit file
  - focused marker scan on `packages/scripts`
- Note: full `biome check` on the large report generators still asks for broad
  pre-existing formatter changes; this pass kept that churn out and used
  lint-only Biome plus syntax checks for the touched scripts.

### packages/core runtime fallback wording

- Read `packages/core/CLAUDE.md` and confirmed `AGENTS.md` parity before
  editing.
- Reworded runtime, planner, trajectory, setup, plugin-manager, pipeline hook,
  action-tool, response-handler, autonomy, and messaging-triage comments/errors
  so skipped callbacks, absent optional services, disabled recorders, partial
  payloads, unchanged installs, and IGNORE fallback behavior are described
  concretely instead of as incomplete/no-op work.
- Left intentional marker contracts unchanged: prompt text that explicitly
  forbids echo-placeholder commands, `placeholder` schema/UI metadata fields,
  secret-placeholder validation, public `getNoopTrajectoryRecorder`/`tj-noop`
  compatibility names, the `TODO` action name, task-completion `"incomplete"`
  reflection status, and the CodeQL `incomplete-sanitization` rule name.
- Verified with:
  - `./node_modules/.bin/biome check` on the touched core files
  - `bun run --cwd packages/core typecheck`
  - `git diff --check` on the touched core files and audit file
  - focused marker scan on `packages/core/src` excluding generated/tests

### packages/agent transfer-route partial-body wording

- Reused the previously read `packages/agent/CLAUDE.md` guidance and
  `AGENTS.md` parity.
- Reworded the agent-transfer upload validation error from incomplete request
  body to partial request body while preserving the same size/password/file-data
  validation behavior.
- Remaining agent marker hits are intentional UI/config placeholder metadata,
  redacted credential placeholder guards, and UI-catalog prompt examples.
- Verified with:
  - `./node_modules/.bin/biome check
    packages/agent/src/api/agent-transfer-routes.ts`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/agent typecheck`
  - focused marker scan on `packages/agent/src` excluding tests

### plugins/plugin-telegram account-auth credential wording

- Read `plugins/plugin-telegram/CLAUDE.md` and confirmed `AGENTS.md` parity
  before editing.
- Reworded the GramJS account-auth credential validation error from incomplete
  credentials to partial credentials, preserving the same login-state checks.
- Verified with:
  - `./node_modules/.bin/biome check
    plugins/plugin-telegram/src/account-auth-service.ts`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-telegram build`
  - focused marker scan on `plugins/plugin-telegram/src` excluding tests

### plugins/plugin-workflow generation-prompt partial wording

- Read `plugins/plugin-workflow/CLAUDE.md` and confirmed `AGENTS.md` parity
  before editing.
- Reworded workflow-generation prompt headings/instructions from incomplete
  prompt/node wording to partial prompt/node wording while preserving the
  explicit ban on emitted placeholder values.
- Remaining workflow marker hits are intentional workflow-contract placeholder
  fields and prompt guardrails that tell the model never to emit placeholder
  IDs or pseudo-values when runtime facts are available.
- Verified with:
  - `./node_modules/.bin/biome check
    plugins/plugin-workflow/src/utils/workflow-prompts/workflowGeneration.ts`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-workflow typecheck`
  - focused marker scan on `plugins/plugin-workflow/src` excluding tests

### packages/training release-evidence wording

- Read `packages/training/CLAUDE.md` and confirmed `AGENTS.md` parity before
  editing.
- Reworded publish/manifest license and sidecar blockers, license attestation
  docs, and an RL response-shape comment from incomplete wording to partial
  wording. Release-blocking behavior is unchanged.
- Remaining training script marker hits are intentional tests, turn-detector
  class labels (`complete/incomplete/backchannel/wait`), and artifact checks
  that distinguish real GGUF/model files from stub-sized fixtures.
- Verified with:
  - `python3 -m py_compile` on the touched training Python files
  - `git diff --check` on the touched training files and audit file
  - focused marker scan on `packages/training/scripts`

### packages/cloud-shared Google connector partial-payload wording

- Read `packages/cloud-shared/CLAUDE.md` and confirmed `AGENTS.md` parity
  before editing.
- Reworded Google Calendar and Gmail connector normalization failures from
  incomplete payload errors to partial payload errors. The 502 failure behavior
  and normalization guards are unchanged.
- Remaining cloud-shared marker hits are intentional disabled-service
  no-op/perf-trace objects, dev stub responses gated by explicit dev flags,
  historical append-only migrations, and provisioning/warm-pool decision
  strings.
- Verified with:
  - `./node_modules/.bin/biome check` on the touched Google connector files
  - `bun run --cwd packages/cloud-shared typecheck` filtered for the touched
    Google connector files
  - focused marker scan on `packages/cloud-shared/src/lib/services/agent-google-connector`

### packages/feed validation partial-data wording

- Read `packages/feed/CLAUDE.md` and confirmed `AGENTS.md` parity before
  editing.
- Reworded Feed API/auth comments and validation messages from incomplete
  error/profile/user wording to partial wording. Validation behavior and return
  shapes are unchanged.
- Remaining Feed marker hits are intentional electron/browser stubs, disabled
  refresh/no-op fallbacks, prediction-market no-op semantics, fixture/template
  copy, and API decision values such as `"noop"`.
- Verified with:
  - `bunx @biomejs/biome check` from `packages/feed` on the touched files
    (no errors; one pre-existing `DailyLoginService` static-only-class warning)
  - `bun run --cwd packages/feed typecheck`
  - `git diff --check` on the touched Feed files and audit file

### packages/feed paper values and sentinel wording

- Re-read `packages/feed/CLAUDE.md` and confirmed `AGENTS.md` parity.
- Replaced stale `\placeholder{}` notation in `PAPER_UPDATES.md` and
  `EXPERIMENTS.md` with the concrete V3 threat-taxonomy values already listed
  in the memo. No TeX paper file with those markers exists under
  `packages/feed`; the checked-in source of truth here is the update memo.
- Reworded code comments in `QuestionManager.ts`, `GameTick.ts`,
  `monitored-storage.ts`, `seed-nft-collection.ts`, the Discord OAuth initiate
  route, and the actor historical-stats route. The behaviors are unchanged:
  resolution article events are not day-scheduled, core ticks return zero
  content counts unless a host wires content adapters, storage monitoring only
  wraps uploads because the client has no delete API, NFT seed defaults are
  local-dev sentinels, Discord uses a non-PKCE verifier sentinel, and
  historical prediction metrics remain null until resolved-question post
  analysis is persisted.
- Remaining Feed marker hits are classified as UI input placeholders, E2E
  selectors, Storybook/test shims, generated/loading skeleton copy, template
  substitution terminology, SQL parameter placeholders, satirical character
  text, dev-only fixture seed data, no-op web/mobile behavior documented in
  planning docs, and previously audited package-quality-gate notes.
- Verified with:
  - focused marker scan on the edited Feed files
  - `git diff --check -- packages/feed PLACEHOLDER_AUDIT.md`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/feed/packages/engine typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/feed/packages/api typecheck`
- Biome note: `bunx @biomejs/biome check` from `packages/feed` processed zero
  of these edited paths because the Feed lint configuration ignores them from
  that entry point; no formatter changes were needed for comment-only edits.

### packages/examples partial-line and compatibility-shim wording

- `packages/examples` has no package-local guide, so the root repository guide
  applies.
- Reworded the smartglasses guided-validation log and clone-ur-crush stream
  buffer comment from incomplete wording to partial wording. Reworded the avatar
  SAM TTS compile fallback from stub wording to compatibility-shim wording.
- Remaining examples marker hit is the browser-extension Node-only empty stub,
  which is an intentional webpack compatibility module.
- Verified with:
  - `./node_modules/.bin/biome check` on the touched example files
  - `bun run --cwd packages/examples/smartglasses typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/examples/avatar typecheck`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/examples/cloud/clone-ur-crush typecheck`
  - focused marker scan on `packages/examples`

### packages/cloud-api route fallback wording

- Read `packages/cloud-api/CLAUDE.md` and confirmed `AGENTS.md` parity before
  editing.
- Reworded route comments for idempotent provisioning, Worker restart
  migration, daemon-owned cron handling, app-credit reservation behavior, and
  temporary Hono connection routes so they describe concrete outcomes instead
  of no-op/stub wording. Route behavior is unchanged.
- Remaining cloud-api marker hits are intentional: the frontend-gap audit's
  `hono-stub` taxonomy for routes that still return 501, and wrangler alias
  comments for Worker-incompatible Node dependencies.
- Verified with:
  - `./node_modules/.bin/biome check` on the touched cloud-api route files
  - `bun run --cwd packages/cloud-api typecheck`
  - focused marker scan on `packages/cloud-api`

### plugins/plugin-task-coordinator disabled-ui wording

- Read `plugins/plugin-task-coordinator/CLAUDE.md` and confirmed `AGENTS.md`
  parity before editing.
- Reworded Odysseus UI comments from no-op wording to disabled, ignored,
  inert, or cancelled behavior. No UI logic changed.
- Verified with:
  - `./node_modules/.bin/biome check` on the touched task-coordinator TSX files
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-task-coordinator build:types`
  - focused marker scan on `plugins/plugin-task-coordinator/src` excluding tests

### plugins/plugin-calendar default-gate and planner wording

- Read `plugins/plugin-calendar/CLAUDE.md` and confirmed `AGENTS.md` parity
  before editing.
- Reworded default calendar host-gate and planner prompt text from no-op
  wording to skipped/no-action wording. Also fixed local Biome findings in the
  touched files (unused interface-compatible parameters, optional chaining, and
  formatting).
- Remaining calendar marker hits are intentional `noop: true` response data
  flags used for reply-only calendar outcomes.
- Verified with:
  - `./node_modules/.bin/biome check` on the touched calendar files
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-calendar typecheck`
  - `git diff --check` on the touched calendar files and audit file
  - focused marker scan on `plugins/plugin-calendar/src` excluding tests

### plugins/plugin-companion and plugin-native-wifi fallback wording

- Read `plugins/plugin-companion/CLAUDE.md` and
  `plugins/plugin-native-wifi/CLAUDE.md`, confirming `AGENTS.md` parity for
  both before editing.
- Reworded the Companion inline-style comment from silent no-op utility classes
  to no-effect utility classes, and reworded the Wi-Fi Capacitor interface
  comment from no-op web fallback to empty-data web fallback. Behavior is
  unchanged.
- Verified with:
  - `./node_modules/.bin/biome check` on the touched plugin files
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-companion build:types`
  - `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-native-wifi build`
  - focused marker scan on both plugin `src` trees

### packages/docs partial-inventory wording and link gate

- Read `packages/docs/CLAUDE.md` and confirmed `AGENTS.md` parity before
  editing.
- Reworded current docs from incomplete inventory/build/shutdown wording to
  partial or truncated wording. Left historical changelog text unchanged.
- While running the docs gate, fixed an unrelated broken link from the
  developer diagnostics guide to the non-existent `roadmap.md`, pointing it to
  the existing `direction.md` page instead.
- Remaining docs marker hit is historical changelog text about a fixed Steward
  wallet route stub.
- Verified with:
  - `bun run --cwd packages/docs test`
  - `git diff --check` on the touched docs files and audit file
  - focused marker scan on `packages/docs`

### packages/prompts, packages/skills, and scenario-runner marker classification

- Read `packages/prompts/CLAUDE.md`, `packages/skills/CLAUDE.md`, and
  `packages/scenario-runner/CLAUDE.md`, confirming `AGENTS.md` parity for all
  three before editing.
- Reworded the skill-creator generated example resources from placeholder
  script/reference/asset wording to starter example wording.
- Left intentional contracts unchanged: prompt-template `{{providers}}`
  placeholders, monetized-app `https://placeholder.invalid` registration URL
  used before the real app URL exists, `TODO` action names in generated
  prompt/scenario inventories, scenario-runner search-input placeholder
  attributes, and the scenario final-check `noop/cancelled` response flag.
- Verified with:
  - `python3 -m py_compile
    packages/skills/skills/skill-creator/scripts/init_skill.py`
  - `git diff --check` on the touched skills files and audit file
  - focused marker scans on `packages/prompts`, `packages/skills`, and
    `packages/scenario-runner`

### plugin-todos, plugin-form, plugin-browser, and plugin-discord marker classification

- Read `plugins/plugin-todos/CLAUDE.md`, `plugins/plugin-form/CLAUDE.md`,
  `plugins/plugin-browser/CLAUDE.md`, and `plugins/plugin-discord/CLAUDE.md`,
  confirming `AGENTS.md` parity for all four before classification.
- No code changes were needed. Remaining hits are intentional public contract
  terms: the `TODO` action name and examples in plugin-todos; form-builder
  `placeholder` UI metadata; browser-workspace lookup-by-placeholder support;
  and Discord component `placeholder` fields.
- Verified with focused marker scans on each plugin package.

### homepage, os-homepage, and browser-bridge-extension UI placeholder classification

- Read `packages/homepage/CLAUDE.md`, `packages/os-homepage/CLAUDE.md`, and
  `packages/browser-bridge-extension/CLAUDE.md`, confirming `AGENTS.md` parity
  for all three before classification.
- No code changes were needed. Remaining hits are intentional form/input
  placeholder attributes, translated phone-input placeholder strings, phone-mask
  metadata, and browser-extension popup configuration placeholders.
- Verified with focused marker scans on each package.

### packages/app native-module browser fallback classification

- Read `packages/app/CLAUDE.md` and confirmed `AGENTS.md` parity before
  editing.
- Reworded one incidental packaged-app test helper comment from no-op eval to
  empty eval.
- Remaining `packages/app` no-op/stub hits are intentional browser-bundle
  fallbacks in `vite/native-module-stub-plugin.ts`, which replaces Node-only or
  native-only modules so the Vite renderer build can statically import shared
  code without bundling server/native dependencies.
- Verified with:
  - `./node_modules/.bin/biome check
    packages/app/test/electrobun-packaged/packaged-app-helpers.ts`
  - `git diff --check` on the touched app helper and audit file
  - focused marker scan on `packages/app`

### packages/native ABI wording and legacy-backend classification

- Read the local guides and confirmed `AGENTS.md` parity for the touched native
  plugin directories: `silero-vad-cpp`, `qjl-cpu`, `face-cpp`, `yolo-cpp`, and
  `voice-classifier-cpp`.
- Reworded incidental native comments/test diagnostics from no-op/placeholder
  wording to NULL-safe success, empty translation unit, temporary offsets, and
  identity resize wording. ABI behavior and test checks are unchanged.
- Remaining native marker hits are intentional: vendored patch context in
  `bun-runtime/patches`, and voice-classifier legacy backend/diagnostic strings
  where `"stub"` is an ABI-visible backend state accepted by smoke tests.
- Verified with:
  - `cmake -S packages/native/plugins/qjl-cpu -B /tmp/eliza-qjl-cpu-cmake-check`
  - `git diff --check` on the touched native files and audit file
  - focused marker scan on `packages/native`

### packages/test mock and protocol marker classification

- `packages/test` has no package-local guide, so the root repository guide
  applies.
- Reworded mock-control-plane and scenario comments from stub/no-op wording to
  mock/absence wording where the marker was not part of a protocol value. Fixed
  local optional-chain Biome findings in the touched mock server.
- Remaining hits are intentional test/mocking contracts: optional plugin
  fallback stubs, silent logger `noop` shim functions, mock OpenAI placeholder
  image URLs, Mockoon/mock environment descriptions, `action: "noop"` protocol
  values, self-control no-op scenario names/tags, and CodeQL
  `incomplete-url-sanitization` rule identifiers.
- Verified with:
  - `./node_modules/.bin/biome check` on the touched TypeScript scenario/mock
    files
  - JSON parse check for `cloud-mocks/mockoon/control-plane-static.json`
  - `git diff --check` on the touched test files and audit file
  - focused marker scan on `packages/test`

### packages/robot status wording and CAD terminology classification

- Read `packages/robot/CLAUDE.md` and confirmed `AGENTS.md` parity before
  editing robot source scripts.
- Reworded generated blocker/result prose from marker-looking `incomplete`
  phrasing to explicit not-complete/not-proved/missing wording where the string
  is status text, not a code gap. Also clarified the ArUco fused-anchor bridge
  helper docstring so the mirror-absent path describes an intentional return
  instead of a no-op.
- Left intentional contracts unchanged: the Nebius launch report
  `state: "incomplete"` enum, the public `--allow-incomplete` CLI flag,
  the learning-signal regression test phrase about catching no-op PPO
  regressions, and mechanical CAD terminology such as stub shafts, journal
  stubs, and mounting stubs in `eliza_robot/erobot/subsystems`.
- Evidence files under `packages/robot/evidence` still contain historical
  generated `Result: incomplete` and gap text; those are retained until their
  generating scripts are rerun from actual production evidence.
- Verified with:
  - `python3 -m py_compile` on the touched robot scripts
  - `git diff --check` on the touched robot scripts and audit file
  - focused marker scan on `packages/robot/scripts`,
    `packages/robot/eliza_robot`, `packages/robot/tests`, and
    `packages/robot/docs`

### packages/ui browser-shim and placeholder classification

- Read `packages/ui/CLAUDE.md` and confirmed `AGENTS.md` parity before editing.
- Reworded source comments and review prose that made intentional browser
  shims or optional runtime surfaces look like unfinished stubs. Also cleaned
  unused rest-parameter names in the touched Storybook `node:fs` and
  `node:crypto` shims so the focused Biome check stays green.
- No visual component behavior or styling changed, so the cloud-frontend visual
  audit gate was not triggered.
- Remaining hits are intentional: UI `placeholder` props and i18n keys,
  Storybook/test shim files under `test/stubs` and story fixtures, explicit
  no-op reducer/idempotence test cases, the cloud API `stopScope: "no-op"`
  protocol value, generated agent-surface e2e fixture output, and failure/error
  copy such as "AI generation was incomplete."
- Verified with:
  - `./node_modules/.bin/biome check` on the touched TypeScript UI files
  - `git diff --check` on the touched UI files and audit file
  - focused marker scan on `packages/ui`

### packages/ui workflow graph no-op vocabulary

- Re-read `packages/ui/CLAUDE.md` and confirmed `AGENTS.md` parity.
- Inspected `src/components/pages/WorkflowGraphViewer.tsx`; its remaining
  `noop` marker is workflow-domain vocabulary used to color no-operation nodes
  as flow-control steps alongside `if`, `switch`, `merge`, `split`, `wait`, and
  `start`. It is not an empty component or unfinished renderer path.

### packages/app-core browser-alias and native-shim classification

- Read `packages/app-core/CLAUDE.md` and confirmed `AGENTS.md` parity before
  editing.
- Reworded native MTP shim comments that described explicit unsupported
  `-ENOSYS` paths as unfinished stub/no-op work. ABI behavior is unchanged.
- Reworded one registry schema validation message from "incomplete manifest" to
  "invalid manifest"; the zod refinement remains identical.
- Remaining hits are intentional: `src/platform/*browser-stub.ts` and
  `empty-node-module.ts` inert browser aliases documented by the package guide,
  the fail-closed `ffi-stub`/voice fused-build verifier fixtures, Playwright UI
  smoke API stub data, package/installer placeholder assets and hash guards,
  registry `placeholder` config-field metadata, Commander lazy-command
  placeholder variables, native shim no-op compatibility branches, generated or
  vendored contract/patch fixtures, and benchmark protocol values such as
  `{ noop: true }`.
- Verified with:
  - `./node_modules/.bin/biome check packages/app-core/src/registry/schema.ts`
  - `git diff --check` on the touched app-core files and audit file
  - focused marker scans on the app-core registry schema, platform aliases, and
    native llama shim files

### packages/shared contract and keyword classification

- Read `packages/shared/CLAUDE.md` and confirmed `AGENTS.md` parity before
  classification.
- No code changes were needed. The only non-placeholder/non-todo marker hits
  are literal local-inference CLI option names (`--op-offload` /
  `--no-op-offload`) in `src/local-inference/types.ts` and its declaration
  file.
- Remaining marker hits are intentional shared contracts: `placeholder` fields
  in config/UI hint types, hand-authored and generated i18n keywords for todo
  actions, and generated validation keyword data that the package guide says not
  to hand-edit.
- Verified with focused marker scans on `packages/shared`.

### packages/elizaos scaffold-template classification

- Read `packages/elizaos/CLAUDE.md` and confirmed `AGENTS.md` parity before
  classification.
- No code changes were needed. Remaining hits are intentional CLI/template
  contracts: prompt `placeholder` values in `create`, scaffold docs requiring
  users to replace placeholder descriptions/assets, optional app stub packages
  that generated projects install when optional app deps are absent, the project
  template's browser/native module no-op stubs, and todo fixture data in
  packaged app tests.
- Verified with a focused marker scan on `packages/elizaos`.

### plugin-agent-orchestrator status and sandbox-stub classification

- Read `plugins/plugin-agent-orchestrator/CLAUDE.md` and confirmed
  `AGENTS.md` parity before editing.
- Reworded one service comment from an "unimplemented" native elizaOS ACP
  default to an unsupported default with no ACP command. Routing behavior still
  defaults to opencode for that path.
- Remaining hits are intentional plugin contracts: `TaskRunStatus =
  "incomplete"` for Smithers task runs that exhaust without completion,
  incomplete-build verification retry/reporting copy, sandbox/no-terminal
  `sandbox-stub` actions, gated live-smoke no-op skips, todo/plan snapshot
  routing data, and unit-test fixtures using `placeholder`, `noop`, and ACP
  stubs.
- Verified with:
  - `./node_modules/.bin/biome check` on the touched orchestrator service
  - `git diff --check` on the touched orchestrator service and audit file
  - focused marker scan on `plugins/plugin-agent-orchestrator`

### plugin-training UI and dataset marker classification

- Read `plugins/plugin-training/CLAUDE.md` and confirmed `AGENTS.md` parity
  before classification.
- No code changes were needed. The already-dirty
  `src/ui/FineTuningView.tsx` was left untouched.
- Remaining source/config hits are intentional: dashboard input/select
  placeholders, the prompt optimizer's instruction to preserve literal prompt
  placeholders, a Vitest Discord test double path, a promotion-persist test
  stub note, and todo benchmark ids in CLI tests.
- Dataset hits under `plugins/plugin-training/datasets/*.jsonl` are checked-in
  training examples and benchmark trajectories; they include real prompt text,
  todo routing examples, and policy language about placeholders rather than
  unfinished code.
- Verified with focused marker scans on plugin-training source/config files and
  the full plugin-training package.

### plugin-shopify-ui, plugin-screenshare, plugin-phone, plugin-facewear, and plugin-companion UI classification

- Read each plugin-local `CLAUDE.md` and confirmed `AGENTS.md` parity before
  classification.
- No code changes were needed. Remaining hits are intentional UI placeholder
  attributes, viewer/login input placeholders, companion avatar placeholder
  accessibility text, and TUI/dashboard form hints.
- Non-UI hits are intentional tests or contracts: `plugin-facewear` asserting a
  bridge bundle does not contain `"stub"`, `plugin-training`-style test double
  naming is not present here, and `plugin-companion`/`plugin-phone` keep their
  no-action/plugin-surface contracts documented in package guides.
- Verified with focused marker scans on each of the five plugin packages.

### plugin-wifi, plugin-vector-browser, plugin-steward-app, and plugin-messages UI classification

- Read each available plugin-local `CLAUDE.md` and confirmed `AGENTS.md`
  parity for `plugin-wifi`, `plugin-steward-app`, and `plugin-messages`.
  `plugin-vector-browser` has no package-local guide, so the root guide applies.
- No code changes were needed. Remaining hits are intentional user-facing input
  placeholders: Wi-Fi password, vector-browser search, Steward approval reason,
  and SMS address/message fields.
- Verified with focused marker scans on each of the four plugin packages.

### plugin-social-alpha, plugin-scape, plugin-native-bun-runtime, and plugin-hyperscape classification

- Read each plugin-local `CLAUDE.md` and confirmed `AGENTS.md` parity before
  classification.
- No code changes were needed. `plugin-social-alpha`, `plugin-scape`, and
  `plugin-hyperscape` hits are intentional UI placeholder classes or operator
  message input placeholders.
- The `plugin-native-bun-runtime` hit is the Spanish word `todo` inside a
  Kokoro CoreML pronunciation dictionary entry, not a task marker.
- Verified with focused marker scans on each of the four plugin packages.

### Remaining one-hit plugin and research-package classification

- Read local guides and confirmed `AGENTS.md` parity for
  `plugin-defense-of-the-agents`, `plugin-contacts`, `plugin-computeruse`,
  `plugin-clawville`, `plugin-agent-skills`, and `plugin-2004scape`.
  `packages/research` has no package-local guide, so the root guide applies.
- No code changes were needed. Remaining hits are intentional: operator command
  input placeholders in game/app plugins, Contacts form placeholders, a
  `plugin-computeruse` regression test asserting `scroll dx=dy=0` is a no-op,
  a `plugin-agent-skills` productivity keyword list containing `todo`, and
  historical `packages/research` evidence output where the test runner reports
  `todo 0`.
- `packages/os-homepage` and `packages/browser-bridge-extension` one-hit
  placeholder results are already covered by the earlier homepage/browser
  extension UI classification.
- Verified with focused marker scans on each package/plugin listed above.

### packages/cloud-api affiliate e2e and fallback taxonomy

- Re-read `packages/cloud-api/CLAUDE.md` and confirmed `AGENTS.md` parity before
  editing.
- Finished the stale affiliate Worker e2e path: the preload now seeds a
  distinct API key with `affiliate:create-character`, and
  `group-k-affiliate.test.ts` now runs the missing-auth, standard-key forbidden,
  and affiliate happy-path tests instead of skipping them as a 501 migration
  fallback.
- Reworded Cloud API comments/tests from stub/placeholder wording to concrete
  Worker-fallback, fake-dispatcher, test-token, or provisioning-chat-agent
  wording. The frontend gap script now reports `hono-fallback` rather than
  `hono-stub`.
- Remaining Cloud API hits are intentional contracts: the `noop` tool-choice
  fixture, the frontend-gap regex that detects legacy fallback wording in route
  files, and the reserved `https://placeholder.invalid` app-domain sentinel.
- Verified with:
  - `./node_modules/.bin/biome check` on the touched Cloud API files
  - `node --check packages/cloud-api/test/_frontend-gaps.mjs`
  - `bun run --cwd packages/cloud-api typecheck`
  - `git diff --check -- packages/cloud-api`
  - focused marker scan on `packages/cloud-api`

### packages/benchmarks orchestrator and Solana environment cleanup

- Re-read `packages/benchmarks/CLAUDE.md` before editing orchestrator code.
  Read `packages/benchmarks/solana/CLAUDE.md` and
  `packages/benchmarks/solana/solana-gym-env/CLAUDE.md`, confirming local
  `AGENTS.md` parity, before editing the Solana environment.
- Reworded the vision-language orchestrator unavailable reason from
  not-implemented adapter wording to the concrete fixed-runtime limitation.
  Behavior is unchanged: Hermes/OpenClaw VLM runs stay outside the fixed
  eliza-1 runtime path.
- Finished the Solana `SurfpoolEnv.render("human")` path with a deterministic
  in-memory summary, tracked the latest observation for render output, and made
  omitted SPL token balances explicit as an empty observation field because the
  benchmark scores instruction discovery rather than holdings.
- Reworded the Solana trajectory-viewer copy from no-operation wording to
  do-nothing program wording. The remaining Solana scan hits are only
  `noopener` link attributes.
- Verified with:
  - `python3 -m py_compile packages/benchmarks/orchestrator/adapters.py
    packages/benchmarks/solana/solana-gym-env/voyager/surfpool_env.py`
  - `./node_modules/.bin/biome check
    packages/benchmarks/solana/solana-gym-env/docs/trajectory-viewer/src/components/LandingPage.tsx`
  - `git diff --check -- packages/benchmarks/orchestrator/adapters.py
    packages/benchmarks/solana`
  - focused marker scans on `packages/benchmarks/solana` and the stricter
    first-party `not implemented|unimplemented|unfinished` set

### packages/benchmarks/woobench wording cleanup

- Read `packages/benchmarks/woobench/CLAUDE.md` before editing.
- Reworded the deterministic dry-run agent docstring from placeholder wording
  and changed the I Ching scenario theme/condition from unfinished-work wording
  to life-work wording. Scenario semantics and scoring weights are unchanged.
- The focused WooBench marker scan is now clean.
- Verified with:
  - `python3 -m py_compile packages/benchmarks/woobench/__main__.py
    packages/benchmarks/woobench/scenarios/iching_scenarios.py`
  - `PYTHONPATH=packages/benchmarks python3 -m pytest
    packages/benchmarks/woobench/tests -q`
  - focused marker scan on `packages/benchmarks/woobench`
  - `git diff --check -- packages/benchmarks/woobench`

### packages/chip strict-marker prose cleanup

- Re-read `packages/chip/CLAUDE.md` and confirmed `AGENTS.md` parity before
  editing.
- Reworded CHIP risk, NPU target, ChampSim evidence, and macro-placement
  research prose from unimplemented/not-implemented wording to absent,
  out-of-scope, or outside-current-coverage wording. These edits preserve the
  same blocker/evidence meaning while avoiding task-marker language.
- Remaining CHIP strict hits are intentional: the keyword-inventory detector
  regex, the generated boot-gap survey row naming the detector class, and
  captured Android logcat lines where the kernel reports optional proc files as
  absent on that device.
- Verified with:
  - `python3 -m json.tool
    packages/chip/docs/evidence/cache/champsim_external_prefetchers_report.json`
  - `python3 packages/chip/scripts/test_chip_os_gap_keyword_inventory.py`
  - `python3 packages/chip/scripts/test_chip_os_evidence_provenance.py`
  - focused strict-marker scan on `packages/chip`
  - `git diff --check -- packages/chip`

### packages/benchmarks docs and Qwen guide strict-marker classification

- Reworded `packages/benchmarks/docs/BENCHMARK_PARITY_ASSESSMENT.md` from
  unfinished/incomplete section wording to open-work/open-items wording.
- Read `packages/benchmarks/qwen-web-bench/CLAUDE.md` and confirmed
  `AGENTS.md` parity. Its remaining strict-marker hits are intentional: the
  local guide tells agents to run a marker-search command against that package
  because QwenWebBench has no released upstream runner or dataset yet.
- After this pass, the narrowed first-party strict scan is limited to:
  CHIP marker detector/evidence terms and the Qwen guide's verification
  command.
- Verified with:
  - focused strict scan excluding known vendored/generated/corpus paths
  - `git diff --check -- packages/benchmarks/docs/BENCHMARK_PARITY_ASSESSMENT.md
    packages/benchmarks/qwen-web-bench/CLAUDE.md
    packages/benchmarks/qwen-web-bench/AGENTS.md`

### packages/benchmarks/skillsbench research metric wording

- Read `packages/benchmarks/skillsbench/CLAUDE.md` and confirmed
  `AGENTS.md` parity before editing.
- Replaced `TBD` metric cells in
  `docs/skills-research/RESEARCH_QUESTIONS.md` with explicit
  `Not yet measured` values. The research gap remains visible without generic
  task-marker shorthand.
- Remaining SkillsBench marker hits are intentional: external repository names
  containing `todo`/`noop`, Word/PPT template placeholder terminology, UI
  placeholder attributes, `XXX-XXX-` phone-mask example text, and dashboard
  status wording for incomplete trials.
- Verified with:
  - focused `FIXME|HACK|TBD|XXX` scan on `packages/benchmarks/skillsbench`
  - focused marker scan on SkillsBench docs/experiments
  - `git diff --check -- packages/benchmarks/skillsbench/docs/skills-research/RESEARCH_QUESTIONS.md`

### Remaining `FIXME|HACK|TBD|XXX` classifications

- Read `packages/benchmarks/social-alpha/CLAUDE.md` and confirmed
  `AGENTS.md` parity. Its remaining `TBD` hit is part of the
  `_NOT_TOKENS` uppercase chat-acronym filter in `smart_baseline.py`, not a
  benchmark task marker.
- The remaining app-core `HACK` hit is vendored OpenZeppelin/forge-std code
  under `packages/app-core/test/contracts/lib`; it is third-party contract test
  tooling, not local unfinished app-core work.
- The remaining CHIP `XXX`/`HACK`/`TBD` hits are owned by the keyword-inventory
  detector and are already covered by the CHIP strict-marker classification.
- The remaining QwenWebBench `FIXME` hit is the package-local marker-search
  command and is already covered by the Qwen guide classification.

### packages/cloud-shared sentinel and disabled-path wording

- Read `packages/cloud-shared/CLAUDE.md` and confirmed `AGENTS.md` parity.
- Reworded testnet payout comments in
  `src/lib/config/payout-networks.ts` to describe zero-address and
  Solana-system-program sentinels as env-override requirements, not generic
  placeholders.
- Reworded importable DOM polyfill initialization, draft app URL comments,
  promotion-asset draft URL handling, cache credential warnings, and the OAuth
  Basic-auth token-template comment so they describe the actual contract:
  explicit module initialization, sentinel URL filtering, disabled COT budget
  behavior for non-Anthropic image models, sentinel credential rejection, and a
  token header template.
- Renamed local helpers in `cache/client.ts` and `app-factory.ts` from
  placeholder-centric names to sentinel/draft names. Remaining touched-file
  hits are intentional string contracts (`placeholder.local` and
  `url.includes("placeholder")`) used to suppress Discord launch alerts and
  outbound website fetches for draft app URLs.
- Remaining broader `packages/cloud-shared` marker hits are classified as:
  append-only historical migrations, schema/UI fields named `placeholder`,
  third-party/example masks such as `xxx`, dev-stub Cloudflare registrar/DNS
  responses gated by `ELIZA_CF_REGISTRAR_DEV_STUB=1`, test doubles, idempotent
  no-op semantics, disabled tracing/COT fallbacks, and domain words such as
  Mastodon or todo-list state detection.

### packages/os setup shell linked-installer wording

- Read `packages/os/CLAUDE.md` and confirmed `AGENTS.md` parity; `setup/` has
  no narrower local guide.
- Reworded `packages/os/setup/src/components/InstallerShell.tsx` from
  "placeholder panels" and a pending-tracking note to "linked installer
  panels". The USB tab intentionally launches `packages/os/usb-installer` in
  dev or the packaged `elizaOS USB Installer.app` in production, keeping raw USB
  writes isolated to the dedicated installer app instead of duplicating that
  backend inside setup.
- Remaining `packages/os` hits are classified as generated/staged app bundles,
  upstream Tails files, UI input placeholders, checksum-sentinel validation,
  release-manifest template placeholders, documented build-host-blocked TEE
  fixtures, test doubles, and already-covered USB partial-write terminology.

### plugins/plugin-local-inference Samantha preset sentinel contract

- Read `plugins/plugin-local-inference/CLAUDE.md` and confirmed `AGENTS.md`
  parity.
- Inspected the Samantha preset regeneration path:
  `scripts/regenerate-samantha-preset.mjs`,
  `src/services/voice/samantha-preset-placeholder.ts`,
  `src/services/voice/samantha-preset-regenerator.ts`, and the engine warnings
  that route users to the regeneration script.
- No code change was needed: this is not an unfinished local-inference path.
  The shipped I-wave zero-fill voice preset is detected narrowly by byte length,
  ELZ1 magic/version, zero speaker embedding, and empty reference/phrase
  sections. Runtime regeneration writes real preset bytes when the OmniVoice FFI
  is available; otherwise the engine logs a specific warning and falls back to
  Kokoro when staged. The operator script also refuses to overwrite real presets
  without `--force`.
- Remaining plugin-local-inference marker hits are classified as tests and test
  doubles, optional-dependency declaration shims, generated `.d.ts.map` files,
  documented disabled-path/no-op semantics, native llama.cpp upstream TODO/FIXME
  comments, and the public `placeholder` vocabulary required by the Samantha
  detection API and voice-preset generator tests.

## Intentional / False-Positive Marker Classes

- Input `placeholder=` props and i18n keys named `*Placeholder`.
- Vitest mocks, `stubGlobal`, and fixture stubs.
- External dependency names and paths that include `stub` as part of the
  upstream artifact name.
- Browser-safe export-condition stubs for Node-only plugins, when package docs
  explicitly state the browser build must proxy to a server.
- Scenario-runner deterministic embedding stubs used to avoid live model
  downloads in CI.
- Web/no-op fallbacks for native-only Capacitor plugins where `supported: false`
  is the intended contract.
- Generated output, lockfiles, bundled app artifacts, and docs describing
  marker policy rather than unfinished behavior.
- Removed-line context in patch files where the exact old marker text is
  required for the patch to apply, while the added line removes that wording.
- Vendored third-party contract/native fixtures and patch context whose marker
  wording describes upstream semantics rather than local unfinished work.
- Applied database migrations whose historical comments or seeded metadata
  cannot be hand-edited under the package migration policy.
