/**
 * Local text-to-speech capability — public type surface.
 *
 * Mirrors the layout of `services/imagegen/types.ts` and `services/vision/types.ts`:
 *
 *   - The **request/result** contract every TTS backend implements
 *     (`TtsRequest`, `TtsResult`). The synth target is bytes (PCM/WAV/MP3).
 *
 *   - The **backend** interface (`TtsBackend`) that the WS1 `MemoryArbiter`
 *     registers as the `"speak"` capability handler. One backend per
 *     per-platform TTS runtime:
 *
 *       - `omnivoice` — fused omnivoice.cpp llama-server (desktop + AOSP)
 *         and the FFI streaming path (mobile). Default for tiers 9b / 27b
 *         / 27b-256k and a co-default for 9b.
 *       - `kokoro`    — Kokoro-82M ONNX/GGUF. Default for tiers 0_8b / 2b
 *         / 4b (the low-memory mobile floor). Co-default for 9b.
 *       - `edge-tts`  — Microsoft Edge cloud TTS, wired by
 *         `@elizaos/plugin-edge-tts`. Fallback when both local backends
 *         are unavailable (no GPU, missing weights). Routed via priority
 *         order in the runtime model registry, NOT as a sub-backend of
 *         this capability — Edge TTS is a different `provider` from the
 *         runtime's perspective.
 *       - `fake`      — deterministic in-process backend used by tests.
 *
 * Audio format contract:
 *   The arbiter's `speak` request returns Uint8Array. The bytes carry the
 *   audio container declared in `TtsResult.mime`:
 *     - `audio/wav`       — PCM in a RIFF/WAVE container (OmniVoice path
 *                            produces 24 kHz mono int16 by default).
 *     - `audio/mpeg`      — MP3 (Edge TTS default).
 *     - `audio/pcm-f32`   — bare 32-bit float PCM. Used internally between
 *                            Kokoro's runtime and the streaming sink; the
 *                            capability layer wraps it as WAV before
 *                            returning to TEXT_TO_SPEECH callers.
 *
 * Cache namespace:
 *   `tts-audio`. Keyed on `sha256(provider || model || voice || text)`.
 *   The first-line cache (`services/voice/wrap-with-first-line-cache.ts`)
 *   uses its own keying space and lives at a different layer; the
 *   capability-level cache (when wired) sits between the arbiter and the
 *   backend so it works for both local backends without each having to
 *   re-implement it.

 * Caller request to `synthesize`. `text` is mandatory; everything else is

 *
 * Knob semantics (consistent across backends):
 *   - `voice`: voice id. Kokoro uses ids like `"af_bella"`; OmniVoice uses
 *     a preset path / preset id from the speaker-preset store. Edge TTS
 *     uses Microsoft voice names (`"en-US-JennyNeural"`).
 *   - `speed`: speech rate. `1.0` is normal; `0.5` half; `2.0` double. The
 *     concrete backend maps this to its native knob (Edge TTS percentage
 *     string; Kokoro phoneme stretch; OmniVoice maskgit-step pacing).
 *   - `sampleRate`: target output sample rate when the container supports
 *     it. Backends MAY downsample / upsample to match; omitted = backend
 *     native (24 kHz for Kokoro and Edge TTS; 22.05 kHz for OmniVoice).
 *   - `signal`: abort hook. Backends honor this at chunk boundaries.
