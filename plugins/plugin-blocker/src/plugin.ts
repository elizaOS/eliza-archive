/**
 * elizaOS runtime plugin for the Focus / blocker app.
 *
 * Registers:
 *   - BLOCK umbrella action (target = app | website)
 *   - websiteBlockerProvider and appBlockerProvider (per-turn context)
 *   - WebsiteBlockerService and AppBlockerService (Service lifecycle)
 *   - The drizzle pgSchema('app_blocker') so the SQL plugin can migrate it
 *   - A "focus" view for the dashboard / overlay shell
 *
 * The action / providers / services are stubs in this initial scaffold. Real
 * implementations are migrated from plugin-lifeops in a follow-up pass — see
 * the TODO(migration) comments in each file.
