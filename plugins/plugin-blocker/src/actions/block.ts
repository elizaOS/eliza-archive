/**
 * BLOCK action — focus / distraction-control umbrella.
 *
 * STATUS: stub. The real implementation lives in:
 *   plugins/plugin-personal-assistant/src/actions/block.ts            — umbrella action
 *   plugins/plugin-personal-assistant/src/actions/app-block.ts        — app-target dispatch
 *   plugins/plugin-personal-assistant/src/actions/website-block.ts    — website-target dispatch
 *
 * Target / subaction matrix (preserve when migrating):
 *   app:     block, unblock, status
 *   website: block, unblock, status, request_permission, release, list_active
 *
 * TODO(migration):
 *   1. Move the listed action files into this directory.
 *   2. Repoint imports from ../app-blocker / ../website-blocker (lifeops-local)
 *      to ../services/app-blocker / ../services/website-blocker (this plugin).
 *   3. Drop the dispatch wrappers in plugin-lifeops once parity is verified.
