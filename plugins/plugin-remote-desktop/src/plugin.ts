/**
 * @elizaos/plugin-remote-desktop
 *
 * Owner-only remote desktop session control. Provides a single
 * `REMOTE_DESKTOP` umbrella action with subactions:
 *   - start  — open a session (requires confirmation; pairing code in cloud mode)
 *   - status — look up a session by id
 *   - end    — close a session by id
 *   - list   — list active sessions
 *   - revoke — revoke an active session
 *
 * Backends: Tailscale VNC, Tailscale SSH, and ngrok TCP. Pairing-code gating
 * lives in the underlying RemoteSessionService.
 *
 * TODO(remote-desktop migration): the action handler is currently a stub. The
 * full implementation lives in `@elizaos/plugin-personal-assistant`
 * (`plugins/plugin-personal-assistant/src/actions/remote-desktop.ts` plus its
 * `lifeops/remote-desktop.ts` and `remote/remote-session-service.ts`
 * helpers) and will be ported here in the next migration pass.
