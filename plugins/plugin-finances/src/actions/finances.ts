/**
 * OWNER_FINANCES action stub for @elizaos/plugin-finances.
 *
 * This is a SCAFFOLD ONLY. The real implementation currently lives in
 *   plugins/plugin-personal-assistant/src/actions/owner-surfaces.ts  (ownerFinancesAction)
 * with the underlying money / payments / recurring-charge handlers in
 *   plugins/plugin-personal-assistant/src/actions/money.ts
 *   plugins/plugin-personal-assistant/src/actions/payments.ts
 *   plugins/plugin-personal-assistant/src/actions/lib/payments-recurring.ts (planned)
 *
 * The follow-up migration pass will:
 *   1. Move the OWNER_FINANCE_ACTIONS / OWNER_FINANCE_SIMILES constants here.
 *   2. Move MONEY_PARAMETERS and `runMoneyHandler` (or its successor) here.
 *   3. Replace the placeholder handler below with the real dispatch logic.
 *   4. Drop ownerFinancesAction from owner-surfaces.ts and re-export the
 *      action from this plugin instead.
 *
 * Until then this stub:
 *   - registers the OWNER_FINANCES action name so the planner can plan against it,
 *   - returns a clear "not yet wired" ActionResult,
 *   - never throws.
