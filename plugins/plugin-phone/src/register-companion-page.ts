/**
 * Side-effect entry point — registers the Phone Companion page with the app
 * shell's in-process page registry so it mounts without a dynamic import.
 *
 * The plugin manifest's `app.navTabs` declaration carries a `componentExport`
 * specifier as a fallback for hosts that don't side-effect-import this file,
 * but bundling the component directly avoids the lazy-load fallback path.
 *
 * Load this module once during app startup to register the page.
