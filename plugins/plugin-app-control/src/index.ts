/**
 * @module plugin-app-control
 * @description elizaOS plugin that lets the Eliza agent launch, close, list,
 * relaunch, load-from-directory, and create Eliza apps.
 *
 * Surface:
 * - One unified `APP` action (sub-modes: launch / relaunch / list /
 *   load_from_directory / create).
 * - `available_apps` provider — installed + running apps for the planner.
 * - `AppRegistryService` — persists load_from_directory registrations and
 *   re-registers them on boot.
 * - `AppVerificationService` — verifies created apps and plugins.
